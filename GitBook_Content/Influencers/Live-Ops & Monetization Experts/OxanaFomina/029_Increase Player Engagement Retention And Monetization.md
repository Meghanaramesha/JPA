# Increase Player Engagement, Retention, And Monetization?

###### This approach can help to increase player engagement,  retention, and monetization by providing new content and features in the best possible way.

###### Let’s analyze this approach by comparing the two games Toon Blast by [Peak](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peak/) and Angry Birds Dream Blast by [Rovio Entertainment Corporation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rovio/).

According to [AppMagic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datamagic/), Toon Blast has a cumulative revenue per download of $9.65, while Angry Birds Dream Blast only has $3.83. In 2022, Toon Blast’s revenue was five times higher than that of Angry Birds Dream Blast, despite only having twice as many downloads. I compared and analyzed the event calendar of the two games.  
  
The following features of Toon Blast’s live-ops strategy, in my opinion, contribute to more effective user monetization:  
  
1. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

Toon Blast offers a mini-game event and a separate gameplay event, both of which have additional user monetization mechanics and contributes to the game’s revenue growth.  
2. 𝐀𝐯𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬.

An effective tactic for increasing revenue. For example, Toon Blast has implemented a team competition event that takes place every weekend and is accompanied by a special offer. If a player purchases this offer, all team members receive a bonus.  
3. 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞.

There is an event that motivates players to pass new levels, and it is active every weekend when users spend the most time playing and are more likely to pay for an enhanced gaming experience.
