##### ***Benefits of Advent Calendars***

**Retention**

By offering daily surprises, players are encouraged to return, enhancing game retention.  
  
**Engagement**

Boost involvement with the main gameplay and events. Offering limited-time boosters and event-specific currency can deepen user engagement and prolong gaming sessions.  
  
**Monetization**

Choose the monetization methods that are optimal for your game’s audience: Incorporate special discount offers within the advent calendar as an additional incentive. Add a place at the bottom of the calendar for special offers that you can change during the life of the calendar. Or use another monetization option – sell a calendar.
