# Increase Player Retention Through In-App Purchases

###### *Studios always seek innovative ways to keep players monetized and engaged.*

**Paid Periodic Bonus is an approach where players make a purchase with real money and, in return, receive continuous bonuses. This strategy not only enhances the value of the purchase but also keeps players returning for more.**  
  
This model’s 𝐚𝐝𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬 𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐫𝐞𝐬 and its ability to be tailored to different player segments makes it an invaluable tool for developers seeking to maintain a competitive edge.  
  
**𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬:**  
  
𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧: Players perceive more value in their purchase because it unlocks ongoing rewards.  
𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝: The offer entices players to spend more by presenting a compelling deal.  
𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: To collect all their bonuses, players must return to the game over several days.  
  
🎮 A stellar example this year is the offer ‘Get Chuck And Lots Of Staff Earlier.’ It provides early access to a character, a unique spray, and six-day daily bonuses.
