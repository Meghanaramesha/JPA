**Monetization**

The introduction of the new season pass option enhances monetization for the developer. Previously, players had only one fixed option, paying $5.99 for rewards upon completing eight stages. However, with the new system, players can earn more rewards by actively participating in the game. Now they can choose seasonal pass with 7, 14, and 21 stages. Price starts from $4.99 to $12.99

By offering various tiers of season passes based on player activity, the average spending in the game is expected to rise. Players who are more engaged and committed to completing more stages will naturally invest more in the game to achieve their objectives.  
  
**Engagement**  
  
The level of a player’s involvement in the game is directly tied to the number of stages they choose for their season pass. Opting for more stages means the player must be more active and committed during the event. They will have to complete daily tasks to earn Season Pass points and progress through all the stages within the given timeframe.

With the new system, players have the flexibility to select the most suitable season pass based on their preferred level of engagement and expected rewards. This gives players a more personalized gaming experience, thus increasing overall satisfaction and retention.  
  
Introducing the new season pass option in the game has proven to be a win-win situation for players and developers. Players now have the freedom to choose the level of their involvement, which in turn leads to more significant rewards.

For developers, this implementation has led to improved monetization and increased average spending in the game. Additionally, the new system fosters a sense of engagement and commitment among players, contributing to higher retention rates in the long run.
