# Candy Crush Saga’s Unique Challenge For More Lives

###### The innovative challenge mechanism activates in Candy Crush Saga by [King](https://www.linkedin.com/company/king/) when a player has exhausted all lives, presenting an exclusive opportunity for an additional attempt to conquer the level.

This unique feature, offers a player the chance to earn 1 life as a reward for successful completion of the level. This daily-available challenge surfaces once all lives are depleted, opening a challenge window that grants players an extra shot at level completion, making it a strategic and engaging addition to the game’s dynamics.

###### ✅ 𝐄𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧

By offering an additional attempt after all lives are spent, the game effectively encourages players to continue engaging with it, even after facing setbacks. This can increase the time spent in the game and improve player retention rates.

The incentive of receiving an extra life for completing the challenge not only motivates players to take on the challenge but also adds a tangible reward for success, enhancing the satisfaction and achievement players feel.

###### ✅ 𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥

Allowing players to opt out of the challenge respects their autonomy and personal gaming style. This choice can make players feel more in control of their gaming experience, potentially leading to a more positive perception of the game.

###### ✅ 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭

Making the challenge available once a day can drive daily active use of the game. This not only helps in forming a habit but also ensures consistent player engagement over longer periods.
