###### **#1 Prize Draw**

The game Poker Face by Communix implemented a unique event in which a player can win real money by inviting their friends to play the game.

The Social Casino games YAHTZEE® With Buddies and Coin Master have had giveaways for inviting friends, but the rewards were given in-game currency.

**Other Social Casino games have also featured giveaways for inviting friends, but the rewards were never in the form of real money.**

* The prizes were trips in Jackpot Party Casino, Slotomania, VegasSlotsCasino, and POP!Slots.
* The prizes were gift cards in Solitaire Grand Harvest, Lotsa Slots, and POP! Slots.
* The prizes were phones and gift cards in Cash Frenzy™.
* The prizes were tickets to a sporting event in Bingo Blitz – Bingo & Slots.
