# Enhancing Game Metrics: Seasonal Pass and Super Boosters

##### A variety of Seasonal Passes help you increase the game’s metrics.

The new chargeable Super Booster bonus in Homescapes is a part of the Premium Seasonal Pass rewards.

A chargeable bonus as an event reward has not yet been provided in any of the popular games of this genre. The developers are adding a Premium prize consisting of several parts to the Season Pass, motivating players to progress through the stages.

###### **Benefits of Creating a Season Pass with a Super Booster Bonus as a Premium Prize**

➤ **Motivate to Purchase a Premium Pass**

* The chargeable bonus and its upgrades can only be obtained as part of the paid rewards of the event with a seasonal pass. The upgrade expands the action of the bonus to more levels. This type of reward will motivate players who want to gain an edge in the competition and progress in the game faster to make a purchase. Additionally, this reward may be more attractive to players tired of decoration rewards.

➤ **Increase Revenue**

* The duration of this type of Seasonal Pass is seven days. The event is repeated four times during the month. If the player likes it, they will buy it each week. In a month, the player will spend about 2.5 times more on the Season Pass than they spent before.

➤ **Boost Retention**

* A player can launch the booster once daily during the event. They will try not to miss a single day.

➤ **Engage in Completing Levels**

* The bonus is charged with every move the player makes on the level. As the player makes moves, the bonus bar fills up. A bonus element appears on the field when it is filled. The Super Booster bonus gives advantages in completing levels; the player will try to complete as many levels as possible while it’s active.

Moreover, creating new decorations every month for the Season Pass requires more team resources. The Super Bonus Booster reward is developed once and repeated each second month. Thus, the game team has additional time and resources to create new features or improve existing ones.
