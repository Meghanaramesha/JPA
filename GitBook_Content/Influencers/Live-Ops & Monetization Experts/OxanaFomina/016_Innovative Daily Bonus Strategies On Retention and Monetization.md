# Innovative Daily Bonus Strategies On Retention and Monetization

###### Developers continually optimize and innovate within their games and events to enhance the player experience and foster deeper engagement, retention, and monetization strategies.

A notable trend is the evolution of universally applied mechanics, offering fresh approaches to captivate players. A prime example that caught my attention is the implementation of a Daily Bonus in two notable games:

***Candy Crush Soda Saga** by King* implements a three-tiered daily bonus system.

The first reward is granted immediately upon the player’s login, with subsequent rewards available 4 hours after the previous one is claimed. This incentivizes players to log in multiple times throughout the day, enhancing player engagement.

Should a player fail to return within the same day, they’re greeted with a visual representation of missed opportunities upon their next login, subtly encouraging a habit of regular play. This strategy is particularly effective in new players and re-engaging returned ones.

***Cookie Jam** by Jam City* takes an experimental approach to the daily bonus, offering players an opportunity to double their Daily Bonus for a week through a real-money purchase.

This not only aids in retaining players by incentivizing daily logins but also directly monetizes the return visits, increasing the likelihood of habitual engagement.

**Through these innovative daily bonus systems, developers are improving the game-playing experience and strategically enhancing player retention and monetization efforts.**
