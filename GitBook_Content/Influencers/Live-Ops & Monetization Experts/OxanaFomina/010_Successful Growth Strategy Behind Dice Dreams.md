The Pet Event emerged as the standout success story of 2023, captivating game developers to such an extent that it was adapted and integrated into games across multiple genres. I’ve broken down the key elements and shared insights in my article:[‘How to increase your game’s metrics with a single event’](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/boosting-your-game-with-a-single-event/).

**Lesson one: Diversification of gaming experience through live events**

Dice Dreams implemented a diverse system of live events, each addressing different aspects of gameplay and player psychology.

Various event types show an effort to diversify the gameplay (see events distribution by mechanics table below).

Short-term events dominate. With 54.2% of events lasting 1-3 days and 33.3% lasting 4-7 days, the focus is clearly on short-term engagement. Short-term intensive events, like “Pixie Rush,” with a 50% increase in the chance of rare resources, create a sense of urgency and encourage frequent app opens, boosting daily active users.

Long-term events, like the “Pet” event, lasting 34 days, create a long-term goal, motivating players to return to the game regularly. Events with social elements, like “Team Treasure,” show the best engagement results.

> Rewards from one event, such as pet food, can be utilised in another, forming a cohesive ecosystem that enhances the overall player experience.

Leveraging social connections within the game creates a strong community and improves retention. The mix of short-term and long-term events caters to different player preferences. This balance helps maintain both daily active users and long-term player retention.

This variety ensures a constant influx of new experiences, maintaining player interest over the long term.

**Lesson two: Integration and synergy between events**

The company has expertly interwoven various events to create a dynamic, multi-layered engagement system:

* Cross-event synergy. Rewards from one event, such as pet food, can be utilised in another, forming a cohesive ecosystem that enhances the overall player experience.
* Integrated game features: Events like “Deep Dive Journey” and “Honey Road” are seamlessly connected to other game elements, driving activity across multiple facets of the game. The strategic design of “Honey Road” not only enhances player engagement but also leverages progression and choice mechanics to maximise monetisation potential.

This strategy boosts engagement and unlocks multiple monetisation opportunities.

**Lesson three: Innovative Approach to Monetisation**

Dice Dreams developed a multifaceted monetisation strategy:

* Seasonal passes: “Dream Pass” for $4.99 provides access to exclusive rewards, creating a constant revenue stream.
* Choice system: In events like “Honey Road,” players choose their reward path, stimulating purchases due to FOMO.
* Exclusive offers: Special offers related to events create additional incentives for purchases.
* Events featuring popular game mechanics (such as pets or puzzles) often generate significant revenue.

**Lesson four: Optimisation of player engagement**

The company carefully developed mechanics affecting key engagement metrics:

Increasing time in-game: Events that combine social elements (like Team Treasure) or unique gameplay (like Pixie Rushin) achieve the highest engagement rates.  “Team Treasure” event increased average session time.

> Dice Dreams’ success in multiplying its revenue is based on a comprehensive approach to game design and monetisation.

The frequency of returns: “Royal Puzzle My Pet Special” event increased the number of sessions and revenue.

Balance of short and long gameplay: Balancing session length and frequency is crucial for long-term retention. Events that offer tiered rewards or a progression system (like Deep Dive Journey) effectively increase time spent in the game. A combination of events stimulates both short, frequent sessions and extended play.

**Lesson five: Data analysis and rapid adaptation**

Judging by the frequency of updates and variations in events, the company actively uses analytics to optimise its offerings:

* Regular updates to event design and mechanics.
* Adaptation of event duration and rewards based on player response.

Dice Dreams’ success in multiplying its revenue is based on a comprehensive approach to game design and monetisation. The company created a dynamic ecosystem of events and offers that maintain player interest and create numerous monetisation points.

The key to success was a deep understanding of player psychology, skillful balancing between different types of engagement, and constant data-driven optimisation. This approach allowed Dice Dreams to increase revenue significantly and create a sustainable model for long-term growth in the highly competitive mobile gaming industry.
