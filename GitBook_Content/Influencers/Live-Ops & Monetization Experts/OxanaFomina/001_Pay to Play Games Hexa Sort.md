# Pay to Play Games: Hexa Sort

Puzzle games in the sort genre caught my attention. The first one was Magic Sort by [Grand Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grandgames/), and I played it for a month. I was highly engaged, completed 400+ levels in a short period.  
  
A few days ago, I tried Hexa Sort by [Tripledot Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tripledot-studios/). This is the first time I’ve seen a game treat players in a way that instantly kills its own long-term potential.  
  
The core gameplay is intense. The potential is huge. But the experience is so poorly executed that opening the game becomes exhausting.  
  
This isn’t a pay-to-win game; it’s a pay-to-play game.

The ads are unbearable from day one. After a few days, they become extreme. Removing ads costs €10 per month. €10 for what? For disrespecting the player? I wanted to buy the Battle Pass (also 10 euros). But if I still have to watch ads, why would I pay at all?

When a game lacks basic respect for the player, it doesn’t matter how good the gameplay is. It loses value instantly.  
  
[Sensor Tower](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sensor-tower/) shows the game is currently the second-highest in lifetime revenue among sort puzzle titles, right after Magic Sort. But since January 2025, the game has been steadily losing revenue. And it’s obvious why.  
  
The gameplay is addictive, but the experience pushes players away.  
Sustainable revenue growth never comes from pressure. It comes from elevating the player experience to a point where people want to pay.
