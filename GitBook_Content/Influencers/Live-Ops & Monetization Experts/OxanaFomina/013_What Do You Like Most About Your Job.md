# What Do You Like Most About Your Job?

###### I really enjoy finding cause-and-effect relationships in player behavior, discovering insights in data, exploring games, and identifying triggers and call-to-actions that motivate players to engage, return, and pay.

###### I love learning not just why a game/event/offer evokes certain emotions and feelings, but most importantly, because of what?

I am fascinated by deconstructing the gameplay and events to understand the secret to a game’s success. I am incredibly inspired when I see the beauty and pattern of engagement and monetization mechanics. I sincerely admire the work that the game creators have done, and I often want to meet and learn about those who have created a particular event or mechanic in a game.

I feel absolute exhilaration when I first research an event and it seems genius to me, and then I study the game’s metrics during the first launch of this event and see that YES! The event is really well made and liked not only by me but, most importantly, by most of the players, and all metrics confirm this. It’s like searching for pearls in the world of mobile games, the thrill, the pleasure from the process, and the reward in the form of new knowledge!

**At heart, I am a researcher, and I enjoy exploring methods and mechanics that lead to the success of gaming companies.**
