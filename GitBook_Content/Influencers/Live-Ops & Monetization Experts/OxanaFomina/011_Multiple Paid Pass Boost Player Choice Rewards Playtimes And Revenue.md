In 2023-2024, many free-to-play games began introducing a new mechanic called the “Multiple Pass”. This approach involves offering several paid pass options that may vary in price and the benefits they include.

Introducing the new season pass option in the game has proven to be a win-win situation for players and developers. Players have the freedom to choose the level of their involvement, which in turn leads to more significant rewards. For developers, this implementation has led to improved monetization and increased average spending in the game. Additionally, the new system fosters a sense of engagement and commitment among players, contributing to higher rates in the long run.

This article explores this trend based on an analysis of 44 games from 16+ genres that have integrated additional paid pass offers. The genre with the most games featuring additional paid passes is match-3, which has seven. Following closely are slots, with six games, and time management, with five.

#### **Prices**

A diverse and dynamic pricing landscape in the Battle Pass, with developers experimenting with different models to optimize revenue and engagement. The range in price points from under a dollar to nearly fifty dollars reflects a broad targeting strategy to appeal to as wide an audience as possible.

* **In 40 of the 44 games studied, players are presented with two pricing options for a Multi Battle Pass, and 4 of the games have three pricing options.** This indicates a flexible approach to monetization, aiming to cater to different spending capacities within the gaming community.

* **In most games, Multi Battle Pass can be purchased with real money and only in 9% of the games with premium currency.** This advantage caters to players who are actively engaged in the main gameplay by enabling them to earn the Battle Pass, thereby increasing player involvement and retention. As a result, such games may experience improved player loyalty and a higher lifetime value of players.
* **The $4.99 price point** is prominent in the first pricing tier and also appears in the second and third tiers, underscoring its popularity and potential effectiveness in attracting purchases from players.
* **The $19.99 price appears in both the second and third pricing tiers** in a significant number of games (10 in the second tier), reflecting a possibly standard higher-tier pricing point.
* **Four games offer a choice among three different pricing tiers,** demonstrating a more granular approach to segmentation within the market. These games likely aim to maximize revenue by offering a range of options to accommodate varying segments of paying players.
* **A premium currency option across all three tiers** in some games indicates a flexible payment system that allows players to use earned or purchased in-game currency instead of real money. This could appeal to more engaged players who have accumulated such currency.
* **The entry of a premium currency or real money option, along with a tier that requires unlocking**, suggests a layered monetization strategy that encourages continued gameplay and spending, potentially increasing player retention and lifetime value.

#### **Duration**

Battle Passes that last only two days or as long as 45 days indicate a wide range of engagement strategies, with shorter durations potentially driving more frequent engagement and longer ones possibly catering to more casual players who prefer less frequent but more extended engagement periods.

A notable cluster of games offers Battle Passes with durations ranging between 26 to 31 days, likely corresponding to monthly cycles. This duration can be strategic for aligning with monthly user engagement and spending habits.

The most common duration for a Battle Pass is seven days, with eight games offering this length. This suggests a weekly cycle is popular among game developers, which aligns with common weekly play patterns among users.

The variability in durations suggests that game developers are testing different lengths to determine what maximizes player retention and monetization, indicating there’s no one-size-fits-all duration for Battle Passes. The spread of durations reflects an understanding that player investment varies, and offering a range of Battle Pass durations can cater to different types of players, from the highly engaged to the more casual or sporadic gamer.

#### **Number of milestones**

The number of levels games offer in their Battle Passes ranges from as few as 10 to as many as 200. This variety reflects developers’ engagement and monetization strategies to appeal to different player types. The diversity in level numbers suggests that the gaming industry does not have a standard for Battle Pass levels; instead, developers tailor the number of levels to their games’ specific dynamics and player engagement patterns.

The most frequently occurring number of levels in a Battle Pass is 30, with 12 games opting for this structure. This indicates that a 30-level Battle Pass might be considered an optimal length, balancing progress and attainability for players. Six games use Battle Passes with 50 levels. This may suggest a preference for a more extended engagement period, offering players more content and goals to work towards.

#### **Successful Multiple Pass implementation in Brawl Stars**

For instance, after implementing the Multiple Paid Pass, Brawl Stars by Supercell saw a 30% increase in revenue. This change enhanced player satisfaction and contributed to a more sustainable revenue model for the developers.

###### In this event, players earn Battle Pass EXP by completing various tasks, which allows them to level up and unlock rewards.

Players can complete daily, seasonal, special events, and special tasks to earn Battle Pass EXP. Task types vary, such as eliminating opponents or winning battles with specific characters.

The event has 70 levels, available sequentially, with rewards including unique emojis, avatars, and more. Players can earn extra EXP by participating in event battles, especially as part of a team, and by completing special tasks associated with updates or limited-time events. Both free and paid rewards are available, with additional benefits unlocked by purchasing the Brawl Pass or Brawl Pass Plus. Players can buy the Brawl Pass for $6.99 or Brawl Pass Plus for $9.99, unlocking additional rewards and benefits like increased EXP limits, extra tasks, and bonus rewards.

Paid options offer exclusive rewards and a faster progression, enhancing the overall event experience. The ability to change tasks and earn EXP through various methods allows players to progress according to their playstyle. Sequential level unlocking and a variety of task types keep the event engaging and dynamic throughout its duration.

#### **Multiple Pass advantages:**

* **Increasing overall revenue.**By offering various season pass tiers based on player activity, the average spending in the game is expected to rise. Players more engaged and committed to completing more stages will naturally invest more in the game to achieve their objectives.
* **Commitment.** The level of a player’s involvement in the game is directly tied to the number of stages they choose for their season pass. Opting for more stages means the player must be more active and committed during the event. They have to complete daily tasks to earn Season Pass points and progress through all the stages within the given timeframe.
* **Offering choice and control.** With the new system, players can select the most suitable season pass based on their preferred level of engagement and expected rewards. This gives players a more personalized gaming experience, thus increasing overall satisfaction and retention.
* **Activation of new and reactivation of dormant users.** Supercell has introduced a discounted Brawl Pass for first-time buyers and players who haven’t purchased the pass in a while, offering it at $2.99 instead of the regular $6.99. This strategy makes the pass more accessible to new players, reactivates dormant users by incentivizing their return, and enhances overall player loyalty by rewarding commitment, ultimately boosting both short-term sales and long-term retention.

Looking ahead, the Multiple Paid Pass model may evolve to include even more personalized options, potentially integrating with emerging technologies like AI-driven content customization. As developers continue to experiment, we may see new iterations of this model that further push the boundaries of player engagement and monetization.
