###### **Monetization**

𝐀 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫. Players invest considerable effort to attain the highest streak bonus, a milestone they value greatly. The likelihood of players spending money to maintain this status symbol is increased, seeing it as a worthwhile investment to safeguard their progress.

###### Engagement

The loss of a streak often leads to the end of a gaming session. However, with the Win Streak Offer, players are more inclined to continue playing, perceiving the purchase as a second wind—a lifeline that keeps them engaged.  
  
Match-3 games frequently incorporate streak mechanics, compelling players to clear levels consecutively without defeat. The three primary streak formats—streak-rewards, streak-location, and streak-tournament—encourage the use of extra moves and power-ups to maintain a streak.

This offer can be strategically linked with specific events or implemented as a standing feature to enhance its appeal.
