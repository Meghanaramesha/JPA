###### The new event where the player gets a reward multiplier for clearing levels on the 1st attempt has been introduced to Project Makeover.

###### The event appeared in the game only once and has never been repeated.

At the same time, similar events are actively used in games such as Homescapes and Matchington Mansion.

When you are planning an event, it is important to study not only successful cases of its use, but also cases where the event did not lead to the desired results.

Survivorship bias is a type of systematic selection error when there is a lot of data for one group of objects (conditionally called “survivors”) and practically no data for the other (“dead”).

As a result, researchers try to look for commonalities among the “survivors” and lose sight of the fact that no less important information is hidden among the “dead.”
