What to keep your game fresh?  
  
ENTERTAIN YOUR PLAYERS WITH EVENTS!  
  
An event is a time-limited experience that boosts engagement and monetization.  
  
These 11 parts give you a full event view 👇   
  
𝟭. 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲  
  
• Why are you starting this event?  
• No clear purpose means scattered focus.  
• Tip: Express the purpose in 1-2 sentences.  
  
𝟮. 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮  
  
• What targets will define success?

• Tip: Use images to inspire creativity.  
  
𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁

• Tip: Keep the concept jargon-free, and simple.  
  
𝟱. 𝗠𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰𝘀  
  
• How will players interact with the event?

• Tip: Tie mechanics to the core concept.  
  
𝟲. 𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲  
  
• What’s inside or outside the event?  
• No scope causes uncontrolled complexity.  
• Tip: Start with an MVP for new events.  
  
𝟳. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀  
  
• Who is the target audience?  
• No audience focus means no relevance.  
• Tip: Use data to define your player needs.  
  
𝟴. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀  
  
• What limitations affect your event?

• Tip: Turn constraints into opportunities.  
  
𝟵. 𝗥𝗶𝘀𝗸𝘀  
  
• What can go wrong or right?  
• No risk management, no event success.  
• Tip: Prepare backup before launch day.  
  
𝟭𝟬. 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲  
  
• When will the event’s key phases occur?  
• No deadlines result in delayed progress.  
• Tip: Break tasks into smaller milestones.  
  
𝟭𝟭. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻  
  
• How will we reach our players?
