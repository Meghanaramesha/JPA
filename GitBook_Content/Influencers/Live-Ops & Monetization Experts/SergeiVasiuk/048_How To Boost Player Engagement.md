# How To Boost Player Engagement?

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-10.gif)

###### Do you love me?

(my wife’s favorite question after marriage)  
  
Do you think YES is the right reply?  
  
❌ NO!!!  
  
A simple YES is not enough.  
  
You should explain your YES answer.  
  
You should show your EMOTIONS.  
  
• Joy  
• Trust  
• Passion  
• Intimacy  
• Affection  
• Gratitude  
• Happiness  
• Excitement  
• Compassion  
• Commitment  
• …………………….  
  
Oh, and one more thing…  
  
FOREVER!!!  
  
But what was before the marriage?  
  
ENGAGEMENT.  
  
Engagement is a result of experiencing good emotions over a period of time.

Here’s why engaged players matter:  
  
1. Loyalty  
  
Engaged players feel like they’re part of the team, contributing to game progress.  
  
2. Exploration:   
  
Engaged players explore and buy various products, boosting your portfolio’s value.  
  
3. Advocacy:   
  
Engaged players spread the word to attract new players, growing your community.  
  
4. Co-Creation:   
  
Engaged players leverage your product to create their own product or content.  
  
“Too much text, Sergei!” I hear you say.  
  
“DO YOU LOVE HER?” ❤️  
  
I’ll keep it between us because LinkedIn has a 3000-character limit.
