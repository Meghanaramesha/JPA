# What does the Gaming Industry need most right now?

###### Last Sunday, I asked you:

“What does the gaming industry need most right now?”  
  
The post received 600+ comments from you  
  
The most liked comment was from Cole:  
  
“Stop-making-games-to-appeal-to-shareholders-and-get-back-to-making-games-that-appeal-to-players”   
  
(It’s the longest word in English!)  
  
For the rest, I generated a word cloud.  
  
Let’s spread this transformative vibe.
