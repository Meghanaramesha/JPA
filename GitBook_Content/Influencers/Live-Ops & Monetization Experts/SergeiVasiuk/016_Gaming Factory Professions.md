# Gaming Factory Professions

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Gaming-Factory-Professions.jpg)

###### Sorry gamers… but I have to say this! Not everyone is familiar with the inner workings of game development. Sure, I can guess the recipe for Oreo cookies BUT! Outside the factory, guesses turn to crumbs. Absolutely, you’ve got every right to critique the games you buy.

But sprinkle a little #Respect for the devs.  
   
TRUST ME!   
   
Launching a ‘bad’ game is never the goal.   
   
Behind every release is a squad of genius devs, even if it misses.  
   
It’s the collective effort of hundreds, sometimes thousands.
