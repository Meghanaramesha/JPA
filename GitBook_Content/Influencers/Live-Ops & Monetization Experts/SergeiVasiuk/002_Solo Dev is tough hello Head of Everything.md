# Solo Dev is tough; hello, Head of Everything.

**What’s the supreme boss level in game dev?**  
A question comes up a lot from my students  
↳ especially those aspiring to be solo devs.

**Solo dev is tough; prepare to be:**  
• Developer  
• Level Designer  
• Content Writer  
• Game Designer  
• UX / UI Designer  
• Release Engineer  
• Audio Engineer  
• 2D/3D Artist  
• Tech Artist  
• Animator  
• Tester  
  
And the list goes on and on and on…  
  
I’m not here to crush any dreams, but…  
solo ambitions may not always be realistic.  
  
Sure, there are exceptions. 🍀  
  
In truth, creating complex games solo  
requires exceptional talent and ample time.  
  
So, what’s the “boss level” for aspiring devs?

**It’s forming a hashtag#TEAM OF LIKE-MINDED.**

As simple and as challenging as it sounds.
