# I’m 44, and I joined IT in my 3rd year at university.

I’m 44, and I joined IT in my 3rd year at university.  
  
After 25 years in tech and 12 in GameDev, I’ve seen the industry change – rapidly.  
  
But one thing has stayed constant:  
  
THE RACE FOR SKILLED PROS.  
  
What surprises me sometimes is that age bias still creeps in, especially after 50.  
  
• Years of expertise  
• Strong networks  
• Niche skills  
  
These give older developers an edge that many studios value.  
  
Studios need their knowledge.  
  
🔴 But here’s the real question:  
  
Is the gaming industry doing enough to preserve the craftsmanship of older developers?  
  
• Crunches, cancellations  
• Ever-accelerating timelines  
• Constant shifts in technology  
  
These are the realities of the gaming world.  
  
And with all this pressure, investing in talents with decades of experience doesn’t always get top priority.  
  
Yet, studios still want these pros out there, producing.  
  
Because that’s where the money is made, and where they shine.  
  
🔴 But here’s the punchline:  
  
If we want studios to last 200+ years,  
They must invest in mentorship, coaching, and training roles.  
  
Otherwise, the generational shift will stall, and the industry won’t mature.
