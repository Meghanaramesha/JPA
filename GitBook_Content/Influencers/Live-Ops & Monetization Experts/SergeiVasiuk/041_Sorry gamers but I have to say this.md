###### Sorry gamers… but I have to say this!

Not everyone is familiar with the inner workings of game development.  
  
Sure, I can guess the recipe for Oreo cookies  
  
BUT!  
  
Outside the factory, guesses turn to crumbs.  
  
Absolutely, you’ve got every right to critique the games you buy.  
  
Just sprinkle a little [respect for the developers](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=respect&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7218554750848352256) in your feedback.  
  
TRUST ME!   
  
Launching a ‘bad’ game is never the goal.   
  
Behind every release is a squad of genius devs, even if it misses.  
  
It’s the collective effort of hundreds, sometimes thousands.
