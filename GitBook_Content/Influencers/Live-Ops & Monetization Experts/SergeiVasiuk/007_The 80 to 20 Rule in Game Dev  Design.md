###### Stop wasting time on what doesn’t matter.

Focus on the 20% that gets 80% of the wins.  
  
Think about Mario 🍄  
↳ you don’t need to master everything.  
  
8️⃣0️⃣% of obstacles? Cleared with perfect jumps.  
  
8️⃣0️⃣% of enemies? Beaten by nailing 20% of tough levels.  
  
8️⃣0️⃣% of time saved? From just 20% of speedrun tricks.  
  
Same in business. Same in life.  
  
Most people grind on everything, but the top players? They prioritize.
