# Many screw up live service games

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-12.gif)

###### Many screw up live service games by focusing on the wrong things.

(I’ve seen it firsthand)  
  
1. Core Game.   
 ↳ It’s crucial, but it’s not everything.  
  
2. Retention Game.   
 ↳ Most games fail here. Do not miss it.   
  
3. Advocate Game.   
 ↳ Your goldmine, but only if basics are right.  
  
Stop obsessing about a perfect Core Game.   
  
🔴 It’s a trap.   
  
If your players don’t return, polish fails.  
  
🟢 What you need to do  
  
1. Core Game.   
  
Is what your players do over and over again.  
  
What you want to hear:  
↳ “Got it, I know how your game works.”  
  
2. Retention Game.   
  
Is what brings players back repeatedly.  
  
What you want to hear:  
↳ “I’m hooked; I want to keep progressing!”  
  
3. Advocate Game.   
  
Is where your top fans live.  
  
What you want to hear:  
↳ “I’m hosting a live stream for your game!”  
  
Anything else, Sergei? ✋  
  
Don’t wait for perfection.  
  
Engage top players with social features.  
  
Build anticipation with timed mechanics.  
  
Hope this help!
