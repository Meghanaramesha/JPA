###### Most Game Devs Miss This Key Element!

They refine mechanics, visuals, and stories.  
But they ignore the core: player emotions.  
  
Why?  
  
Because emotions seem unmeasurable.  
But emotions are the heart of gaming.  
  
Here’s a 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽-𝗯𝘆-𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗳𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸:  
  
[1] Define the Desired Emotions  
  
Ask: What do you want players to feel?  
Excitement? Fear? Joy? Clarity starts here.  
  
[2] Align Emotions with Genre  
  
Not every emotion fits every game.  
Your genre sets emotional expectations.  
  
[3] Identify Emotional Triggers  
  
Pinpoint key moments to evoke emotions.  
Story twists? Boss fights? It all counts.  
  
[4] Map the Emotional Cycle  
  
• Stimulus (an event in the game).  
• Realization (seeing its value).  
• Reaction (a decision or action).  
• Expectation (hopes for outcomes).  
  
[5] Use Emotional Theories  
  
Maslow: Tap into player motivations.  
Plutchik: Mix and intensify emotions.  
  
[6] Adapt Gameplay Dynamically  
  
Change based on real-time player input.  
Shift NPCs or difficulty for balance.  
  
[7] Balance Emotional Load  
  
Avoid extremes of constant highs or lows.  
Neutral gameplay lets players recover.  
  
Design games that don’t just entertain,  
↳ but move players emotionally.  
  
Which emotion will your game master?
