# Musk + Gaming = ???

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Musk-Gaming-.jpg)

###### “Musk + Gaming = ???” 🎮🤔

Musk’s pitch:  
  
xAI will “make games great again.”  
  
Big talk for a space that eats outsiders.  
  
I’ve read mixed reactions:  
  
Fans:  
↳ He changed cars/rockets – why not games?  
  
Skeptics:  
↳ Games need heart, not just algorithms.  
  
If Musk flops, it’ll be messy –   
but honestly? 💯entertaining.  
  
But maybe he’ll surprise us all.  
The industry could use a shake-up…  
  
just… maybe not this shake-up.  
  
What do you think:  
Revolution or “just Musk being Musk”?  
  
Sound off! 🎤  
  
P.S. Who’s playing for him on Diablo 4?
