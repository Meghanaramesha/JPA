###### 9 Traps That Kill Your Game

(And How to Avoid Every Single One)  
  
Most live service games fail.  
Not because the devs aren’t smart.  
But because they fall into unseen traps.  
  
Here’s the truth: ☝️  
  
If you can avoid these 9 traps,  
you’ll stay ahead of 95% of games out there.  
  
1. Metrics:  
↳ Focusing on revenue instead of fun.  
↳ Fix: Track engagement. Fun = profits.  
  
2. Events:  
↳ Too many events = burnout.  
↳ Fix: Space them out. Keep it fresh.  
  
3. Ads:  
↳ Fake gameplay ads destroy trust.  
↳ Fix: Show the REAL game. Trust scales.  
  
4. Progression:  
↳ Too easy? Boring. Too hard? Frustrating.  
↳ Fix: Balance it for fair rewards.  
  
5. Monetization:  
↳ Pay-to-win drive players away.  
↳ Fix: Offer value. Keep it fair. Win long-term  
  
6. Community:  
↳ No community = no loyalty.  
↳ Fix: Engage through events & social media  
  
7. Onboarding:  
↳ Confused players don’t stick around.  
↳ Fix: Teach the basics in a fun way.  
  
8. Feedback:  
↳ Ignoring complaints is a death sentence.  
↳ Fix: Use feedback to spot issues early.  
  
9. Content:  
↳ No new content? Players leave.  
↳ Fix: Plan ahead. Consistent updates win.  
  
💡 The Bottom Line:  
  
Great games don’t just happen.  
   
You win by making players happy,  
delivering real value, and staying consistent.
