###### New Game Dev Reality Check.

“Publish fast” isn’t always wise.  
  
Deadlines? Budgets? Players don’t care.  
  
Quality beats panic releases. Here’s why:  
  
1. Assuming you know players’ tastes?  
  
❌ Wrong.  
  
Real insights come from player research.  
  
2. Big games = better games?   
  
❌ False.  
  
Focus on core gameplay.  
  
3. Rushed launch?   
  
❌ It’s just “publishing crap.”  
  
No polish = failure.
