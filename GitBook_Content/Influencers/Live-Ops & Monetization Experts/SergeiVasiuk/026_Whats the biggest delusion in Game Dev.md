What’s the biggest delusion in game dev?  
  
I see it all the time.  
  
You think you know what players want.  
  
YOU DO NOT! 🚫  
  
And that’s where everything falls apart.  
  
Mistake №1  
↳ Relying on your past success.  
  
• What worked then won’t work now.  
• Players evolve, so should your approach.  
  
Mistake №2  
↳ Trusting your brand will keep you safe.  
  
• Players aren’t loyal to brands.  
• They’re loyal to experiences.  
  
Mistake №3  
↳ Overhyping your game pre-launch.  
  
• Hype without substance kills trust.  
• Deliver first, market later.  
  
Mistake №4  
↳ Ignoring your scope creep.  
  
• Bigger doesn’t mean better.  
• Keep it tight, keep it focused.  
  
Mistake №5  
↳ Blind faith in your Free-to-Play model.  
  
• F2P isn’t for every game.  
• Know your audience.  
  
✅ Solution?  
  
Stop assuming you know what players want.  
  
Start listening.   
  
Test → Adapt → Evolve.  
  
Your players are your best resource.   
  
Build with them, not just for them.
