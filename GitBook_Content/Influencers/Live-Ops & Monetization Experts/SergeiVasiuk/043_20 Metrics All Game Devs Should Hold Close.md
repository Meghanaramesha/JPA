###### 20 metrics all game devs should hold close.

(there are more, but I’ll keep it simple)  
  
First, remember 3 core pillars:  
  
1. New Players  
 ↳ How you acquire your audience.  
  
2. Active Players  
 ↳ How you retain your audience.  
  
3. Paying Players  
 ↳ How you monetize your audience.  
  
Second, there’s no one-size-fits-all set of  
metrics, but here’s the truth:  
  
20% of your game’s metrics drive  
80% of your game’s performance.  
  
Here are the 20 most important metrics:  
  
📊 Acquisition Metrics  
  
• New Daily or Monthly Active Users  
• CPA (Cost Per Install/Login/Battle)  
• Fraud Share: Invalid ad metrics  
• New Players Retention Rate  
• New Players Churn Rate  
• K-Factor: Viral growth  
  
📊 Retention Metrics  
  
• Daily/Monthly Active Users  
• 1, 7, 30 Day Retention  
• Session Length  
• Session Count  
• Churn Rate  
• Lifetime  
  
📊 Monetization metrics  
  
• LTV: Revenue over player Lifetime  
• ARPPU: Revenue Per Paying User  
• Daily/Monthly Paying Users  
• Average Transaction Value  
• ARPU: Revenue per User  
• Number of Transactions  
• Payer Retention  
• Gross Revenue  
  
Metrics aren’t just numbers.   
  
They’re the story of your game’s world,   
told through data.
