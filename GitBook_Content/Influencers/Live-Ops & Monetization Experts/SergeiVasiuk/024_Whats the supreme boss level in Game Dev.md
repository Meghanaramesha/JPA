###### What’s the supreme boss level in game dev?

A question comes up a lot from my students  
↳ especially those aspiring to be solo devs.  
  
Solo dev is tough; prepare to be:  
  
• Developer   
• Level Designer   
• Content Writer  
• Game Designer  
• UX / UI Designer  
• Release Engineer  
• Audio Engineer  
• 2D/3D Artist  
• Tech Artist  
• Animator  
• Tester  
  
And the list goes on and on and on…  
  
I’m not here to crush any dreams, but…   
solo ambitions may not always be realistic.  
  
Sure, there are exceptions. 🍀   
  
In truth, creating complex games solo  
requires exceptional talent and ample time.  
  
So, what’s the “boss level” for aspiring devs?   
  
It’s forming a hashtag  
[hashtag#TEAM](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=team&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7256983153288835075) OF LIKE-MINDED.  
  
As simple and as challenging as it sounds.
