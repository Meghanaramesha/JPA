###### What to keep your live service game fresh?

ENTERTAIN YOUR PLAYERS WITH EVENTS!  
  
An event is a time-limited experience that boosts engagement and monetization.  
  
Here are 4 components of an event: ☝️  
  
1. Theme.  
  
Drawn from in-game elements, cultural events, media trends, or business collaborations.  
  
2. Progression.  
  
Refer to the mechanics through which players gain value from the event.  
  
3. Promotion  
  
Utilizes communication channels, influencers, or partners to extend the reach.   
  
4. Monetization.  
  
Involves special content either with the event theme, its progression, or both.  
  
Anything else, Sergei? ✋  
  
Define the purpose of the event.  
  
Engage top players with social features.  
  
Build anticipation with timed mechanics.  
  
Hope this helps!  
  
Please repost! ♻️ Appreciate it.  
  
I really want to help many thrive in gaming for a fulfilling, positive, and real life.  
  
And with that → positive, real results.
