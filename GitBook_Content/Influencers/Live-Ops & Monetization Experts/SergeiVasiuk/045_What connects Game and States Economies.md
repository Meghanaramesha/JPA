###### What connects Game and States Economies?

Game economies frame monetization as governance does for business:  
  
• Player Trading  
• Purchase Limits  
• Dynamic Pricing  
• Reward Distribution  
• Virtual Assets Balance  
• Virtual Resource Funding  
• Virtual Currency Inflation Control  
  
A Game Design defines   
↳ the ecosystem where a game can exist.  
  
LiveOps operates  
↳ this system in the most optimal way.   
  
E.G.: LiveOps tracks trades and modifies currency value to stop inflation.  
  
Wish to play & learn economy at school 🔥  
  
Imagine students learning economics through managing virtual game economies.   
  
This approach could revolutionize education, making learning   
  
• practical,   
• engaging,   
• and fun.
