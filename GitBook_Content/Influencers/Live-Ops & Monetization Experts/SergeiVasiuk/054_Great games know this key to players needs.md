###### Great games know this key to players’ needs!

Ever noticed the magic of a successful game?  
 ↳ It’s driven by passionate, engaged players.  
  
(The wheel’s been invented, use it)  
  
Psychologist Abraham Maslow designed a  
pyramid to classify human needs in 1943.  
  
🟢 We all have 5 types of needs:   
  
• Basic needs (food, water, shelter).  
• Safety needs (health, employment).  
• Belonging needs (friendship, intimacy).  
• Esteem needs (dignity, respect, purpose).  
• Self-actualization needs (creation, beauty).  
  
Players are humans  
↳ who seek their needs in your game.  
  
By applying this hierarchy to gamers’ needs,  
you build a community around your game.   
  
🟢 Here’s the Players’ Hierarchy of Needs.  
  
Every level aligns with a player’s needs.  
  
• Basic needs → Fun  
• Safety needs → Trust  
• Belonging → Community  
• Esteem needs → Recognition  
• Self-actualization needs → Contribution  
  
🟢 The hierarchy guides your questions:  
  
• What do players need?  
• Which needs does my game meet?  
• How do I convey these needs to players?  
  
Hey, game developers! 👋   
  
Know your players’ needs!  
  
Which level resonates with you?
