###### Want to keep your live service game healthy?

FOCUS ON THESE METRICS!  
  
I’ve spent 12 years in the gaming industry.   
  
From collecting players’ data   
to ensure game performance results.  
  
Here’s the truth: ☝   
  
20% of your game’s metrics drive  
80% of your game’s performance.  
  
Here’s a metrics breakdown for you.  
  
📊 Growth  
Think Monthly Active Users.   
Blending newbies, core, returners, churners.  
  
📊 Retention  
The crystal ball for future success.   
Watch players at 1, 7, and 30 days.  
  
📊 Engagement  
Measured in active days.  
Smiling curve: where power users shine.  
  
📊 Monetization  
Understanding the ‘why’ behind the spend.  
The meat of revenue, from ARPU to MPU.  
  
📊 Lifetime Value – The North Star  
It’s not just about the time spent in-game,  
but the value players bring during their play.  
  
Analytics aren’t just numbers.   
  
They’re the story of your game’s world,   
told through data.
