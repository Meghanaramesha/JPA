###### 8 Things Games Do Better Than Any Art

People say games aren’t art.   
  
❌ Wrong!  
  
Games do what no other art form can.  
  
Here’s 8 ways games outshine everything:  
  
𝟭. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘉𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘚𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘰𝘯𝘦 𝘌𝘭𝘴𝘦  
  
• Books make you imagine.  
• Movies make you feel.  
• Games make you live it.  
  
Mass Effect → Choices shape your story.  
  
𝟮. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘠𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘧  
  
• A book shows a hero making tough choices  
• A game forces you to make it.  
  
Spec Ops: The Line → Regret every step.  
  
𝟯. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘉𝘦𝘺𝘰𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺  
  
• Movies show only what’s filmed.  
• Games let you look everywhere.  
  
RDR2 → Secrets in every town.  
  
𝟰. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯 𝘣𝘺 𝘋𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨  
  
• ‘Fast & Furious’ won’t teach driving.  
• With racing games you’ll pick up skills fast.  
  
F1 → Even Formula 1 champions use it.  
  
𝟱. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘍𝘦𝘦𝘭 𝘙𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘍𝘦𝘢𝘳  
  
• In movies, the hero is never YOU.  
• In games, your instincts kick in.  
  
Resident Evil 4 → Run or get wrecked.  
  
𝟲. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘚𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘚𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺  
  
• Books and films are linear.  
• Games change based on you.  
  
The Witcher 3 → Your choices matter.  
  
𝟳. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘉𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘊𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘰𝘳  
  
• You can’t edit a movie.  
• In games, you shape the experience.  
  
Minecraft → Create entire worlds.  
  
𝟴. 𝘠𝘰𝘶 𝘔𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘎𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘖𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘛𝘪𝘮𝘦  
  
• Ever rewatch a movie 100 times? No.  
• Gamers grind for years.  
  
CS:GO → 10K hours, and still improving.  
  
📌 Final Thought  
  
If games can teach, shape & challenge us  
↳ Are they more than just entertainment?  
  
Can any other art form do what games do?  
↳ Or are they in a league of their own?  
  
What game changed how you think❓  
  
Kudos to CRACKED for inspiration.
