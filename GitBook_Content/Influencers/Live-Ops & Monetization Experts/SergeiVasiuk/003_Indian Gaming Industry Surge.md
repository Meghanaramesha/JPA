# Indian Gaming Industry Surge

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Indian-Gaming-Industry-Surge.jpg)

[Data here.](https://primuspartners.in/docs/documents/India%E2%80%99s%20$9.2B%20Gaming%20Boom%20Powered%20by%20591M%20Players%20and%20AI_Updated.pdf)

* You missed China.
* You slept on Brazil.

❌ Don’t miss India.  
  
This isn’t “emerging.”  
It’s exploding.  
  
• 591M players.  
• 44% are women.  
• $9.2B market by 2029.  
• 66% live outside metros.  
• 90% of India’s gaming is mobile.  
  
Studios like Nazara, Nodding Heads, and JetSynthesys aren’t chasing global trends – they’re setting them.  
  
Regional content is booming.  
  
But here’s what most studios are missing:  
  
• The talent is trained.  
• The audience is massive.  
• The infrastructure is in place.  
  
If you’re still calling India “the future,”  
you’ve already fallen behind.
