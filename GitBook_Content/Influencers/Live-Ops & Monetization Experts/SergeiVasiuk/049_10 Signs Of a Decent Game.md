###### 10 signs of a decent game:

• Gameplay  
• Story  
• Sound  
• Replay  
• Setting  
• Controls  
• Graphics  
• Challenge  
• Originality  
• Promotion  
  
A decent game is a mix of these elements.  
  
It’s about creating an enjoyable experience.  
  
It’s where design meets player satisfaction.  
  
It’s not about being perfect, but about  
constantly improving.  
  
That’s the true mark of a great game.  
  
And it’s a standard we can all aim for.
