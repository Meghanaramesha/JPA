After a two-week summer break, the best Ad Monetization Newsletter is finally back with more great insights

Let me ask you, what is the single most significant predictor of a user clicking on an ad? You might think it is the creative itself. But it is not. In reality, it is often the end card, the final screen ad networks place on every video creative, that has the most significant impact on Click Through and Install Rates.

Time to go back to April 2022. A simpler time in the mobile ecosystem. Rewarded ads were 30 seconds long and were exited with one click. Interstitial ads were closable after 5 seconds. This is when IronSource began exploring the impact of adding a 3-click-to-exit to the end of rewarded and interstitial videos. I am not sure what the results were, but three weeks later, AppLovin followed and added the same clicks to exit. The creative end card arms race had begun.

Now, in mid-2025, the max duration of AppLovin Rewarded ads is 99 seconds with a 13-second end card that requires two clicks to exit.

These changes were not about improving the player experience. They were about improving network margins. By forcing players to spend more time on the end card, networks drive higher Click Through and Install Rates on their campaigns. The problem is that every extra click away from your game increases the risk that the player will get frustrated and never come back.

Longer end cards indeed increase the eCPM and the ad revenue; however, I have found that the increase in eCPM between the most aggressive and the least aggressive end cards is **never more than 8 percent**. More often than not, the loss in retention from the most aggressive end cards is not worth it.

What you need to remember is that when you start with a new ad network, you are always automatically placed on the most aggressive end card settings. It is vital that for a game or app, you set clear rules on what you accept as your creative lengths and end cards. If you have different settings on different networks, that means that some networks have an unfair advantage in your ad stack. This is also why it is sometimes challenging to get your network partners to change settings, as they do not want others to have an unfair advantage.

I **recommend** having a person regularly check on creative and end card lengths from all ad partners. Then, when reaching out to ad partners for end card questions, always make sure you use the word”

Here is a format that I recommend you use:

***Hi X,***

***We are scaling up the number of impressions shown to users, but we are struggling with retention because the end cards are too aggressive.***

***We are looking for the following formats:***

***Inter: 5-second closable***

***RV: 30-second ad with 5-second end card with a maximum of three clicks to exit***

***We have sent the same message to all our other partners to ensure parity!***

**Best,**

In a competitive ad stack, control over your creative lengths and end cards is not just a detail; it is a lever that can protect your retention and keep your monetization balanced. The networks will continually optimize for their margins. Make sure someone on your side is optimizing for yours.

# **💰Great Content 💰**

Game analytics can feel overwhelming, so we invited someone deep who’s been deep in the trenches. In our latest podcast, we sat down with **Russel Ovans**, former Head of Analytics at Eastside Games, to unpack the world of game data you’ve always been curious about but never dared to ask about.

Russel draws a line between analytics and data science:

* *Analytics* focuses on **cohort-level predictions**
* *Data science* zooms in on **individual player behavior** using machine learning

The key takeaway? **Retention** and **ARPDAU** are your two most important metrics. They’re the foundation for calculating LTV, and without a solid understanding of those, you’re doomed to fail.

He also shares a crucial warning: **don’t launch ad campaigns based on early data**. Doing so can massively delay your return on investment. This episode is a must-watch for anyone who wants to understand basic game metrics and how to read the data. Great content for sure!

# **🎯The Cinderella of the Week🎯**

*Miracles still happen! Despite the highly competitive landscape in mobile, solo developers can still scale their IAA monetized games to impressive levels. This section is to salute you. Why? Because everyone loves a Cinderella story… that’s why.*

Everyone loves a good racing game.In a sea of glossy studio-built racers, solo developer **Marco Pesce** released *Monoposto Lite*, a fast-paced F1-inspired mobile game with dynamic weather, tyre strategy, and pit stops. Remarkably, Marco built everything himself, right down to the audio track.

Since its July 1st release, the game has already racked up **over 1 million downloads** and **$50,000 in IAP revenue**.

But here’s the kicker. *Monoposto Lite* has **no in-game ads**. With this kind of DAU, it is likely leaving **$10,000 to $20,000 per day** on the table. A true indie success story, but also a missed monetization opportunity. I hope Marco will add in-game ads to this game!
