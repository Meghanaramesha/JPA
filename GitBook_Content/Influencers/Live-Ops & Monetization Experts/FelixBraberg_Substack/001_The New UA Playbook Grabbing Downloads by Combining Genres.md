Mobile gaming runs on trends. Whatever converts gets copied across minigame onboardings and UA creatives. In February, Playtika released *Disney Solitaire,* and it spread like wildfire. Unbeknownst to Playtika, the launch massively boosted downloads across the entire Solitaire genre.

Now a new trend is emerging. Savvy developers are taking evergreen categories with consistently high organic and paid downloads, combining them, and capturing demand from both at once. It sounds a bit wishy-washy, but let me explain by telling you about *JigSolitare* by Gamincat.

Soft launched in May 2025, it has already racked up 30 million downloads in under two months and scaled to roughly 2.3 million DAU. Based on my estimates, that puts daily ad revenue at around $130 to $150k, driven almost entirely by between level interstitials.

The core gameplay is a polished, classic jigsaw puzzle where matching pieces smoothly snap together to form a complete image. Once a puzzle is solved, the player sees an interstitial and immediately moves on to the next level.

Despite the name JigSolitaire, there is very little actual Solitaire gameplay. Aside from a brief Solitaire style animation at the start of each puzzle, the mechanics are pure jigsaw. There’s no Solitaire mechanics involved, except for the solitaire animation at the start of every puzzle. That’s the brilliance, summarized relatively easily. It’s a puzzle game that lies about also being a Solitare game.

Looking at their UA, all creatives lean either Solitaire style or puzzle style. That means they can tap into both genres at once, run a wider creative mix, and drive cheaper CPIs at scale. The trend is so strong that even Royal Match has started copying the approach, running puzzle style creatives for their match 3 game.

In other words, this is not about inventing new mechanics, it is about smart positioning. By blending evergreen genres at the UA level, games like JigSolitaire expand their addressable audience, unlock cheaper CPIs, and scale faster.

The mobile games industry pays out roughly $40 to $50 million per day to publishers through the three major mediation platforms. Those payouts, in turn, power more than $65 billion in mobile UA spend every year.

Today, Applovin overwhelmingly dominates mediation.

What most people do not realize is that the same team built both MoPub and MAX, two of the most influential mediation stacks in the industry, both of which were ultimately acquired by AppLovin.

This week, we are joined by mediation heavyweights Jim Payne and Dan Sachs to discuss their new mediation solution, CloudX.

# **🎯The Cinderella of the Week🎯**

*Miracles still happen! Despite the highly competitive landscape in mobile, solo developers can still scale their IAA monetized games to impressive levels. This section is to salute you. Why? Because everyone loves a Cinderella story… that’s why.*

We’ve had a solid 5 weeks since the last Cinderella story. Enter Sven Vucak, who’s scaled his *Imposter - Party Word Game* to 2 million organic downloads in the last 30 days. Now this game is not IAA Monetized, but it does generate about 140k/month in IAPs.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RrLZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bd79bb1-da42-4ea9-8601-668f1e340b53_1565x642.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RrLZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6bd79bb1-da42-4ea9-8601-668f1e340b53_1565x642.png)

Imposter is a social word game designed for groups and parties. Players take turns around a single device and try to figure out who the imposter is while giving clues about a secret word.

We have not seen a true Social Party challenger to Heads Up! since 2014, yet the game has quietly generated around $600k per month in IAP revenue for over a decade. Let’s see if Imposter can finally dethrone it.

Well done, Sven!
