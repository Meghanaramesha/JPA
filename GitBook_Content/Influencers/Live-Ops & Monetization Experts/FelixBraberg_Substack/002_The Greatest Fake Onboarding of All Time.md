I know that this is an ad monetization newsletter. Yes, I know that means mobile advertising revenue. But I can’t help it when I see genius. As they say, credit is due where credit is due. And credit is undoubtedly due. It’s time to acknowledge *Sunday City* by *Kefir* and its ingenious onboarding funnel, which has allowed the game to scale to $70k/day 30 days after launch.

With the rise of Chinese and Vietnamese gaming studios, competition within mobile games has only intensified. This has led to 4X games adopting a First Time User Experience (FTUE) funnel that looks like a casual game, but then leads to either a 4X or a Social Casino Game. Famous examples are Typ Tycoon and Carnival Tycoon, which both have reached $200k/day by looking like idle games that eventually lead to the coin looter core gameplay.

Sunday City takes the art of fake onboarding to another level. The game opens like a third-person GTA-style experience where you freely control your character inside the city. You are guided through simple missions that focus on upgrading your cafe, gradually pulling you deeper into Sunday City. Eventually, the path leads you to the city’s casino. That is where the game's core reveals itself. Sunday City is a social casino slot game. The money you win there feeds back into the city, letting you upgrade businesses across town and reinforcing the entire loop.

Sunday City is, in fact, a social casino game hiding in third-person open-world clothing. What makes this even more impressive is the timing. The game soft-launched in 2023, already using this onboarding approach, which puts it well ahead of the curve. This style allows Kefir to dramatically reduce CPI while still scaling efficiently, because users self-qualify through gameplay before ever realizing what the core loop really is. If execution holds, I would not be surprised to see Sunday City rank among the top five largest slots games by the end of next year, with monthly revenue in the $7 to $17 million range.

To cap it off, while I tip my chapeau to Sunday City and steer this newsletter back to its ad-revenue roots, here is the only ad placement inside the game. Players can watch three rewarded ads per day in the store. At current DAU levels, that single rewarded ad placement should bring in a modest $250-$500/day.
