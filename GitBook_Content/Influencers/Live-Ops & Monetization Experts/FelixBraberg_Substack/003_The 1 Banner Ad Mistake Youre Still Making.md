Last week, someone in our Slack group (shameless plug: Join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/two-and-half-gamers/shared_invite/zt-2lrl3hdjo-bWrJhVNbrmjrMi~~JWEnmg)) asked me a simple question: *“What’s the most common monetization mistake you see publishers make?”*

Without hesitation, I replied: “Banners.**”**

But not for the reason you might think. The mistake isn’t using banner placements; it’s not exposing them to 100% of the demand inventory you can access. Most publishers push live traditional banner networks without realizing that they are sitting on untapped demand.
