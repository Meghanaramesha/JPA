There was a time. A simpler time. A time when eCPMs used to explode for the last two weeks in December. People called it “Q5” because you could earn almost a quarter’s worth of revenue in those two weeks. Those days are now gone, and **Christmas is dead**. Well, at least from an ad monetization perspective.

With changing US consumer buying behavior, Q5 has shifted over the last three years to become the **Black Friday Weekend.** During those four magical days, brands, e-commerce companies, and gaming companies all ramp up their UA budgets. Average eCPMs jump anywhere between **15 and 55 percent**. If you do not plan accordingly for this window, you are leaving money on the table.

Today, I have **eight** tips to help you **boost your Black Friday ad Revenue.**

To increase ad revenue, you can focus on either Demand or Supply.

**Increasing Supply:**

This is where most developers miss easy wins. For one weekend, increase ad exposure while eCPMs are at their peak.

1. **Reduce Cool-Down Timers** - Lower your interstitial cooldowns by 15-20% starting on Thanksgiving afternoon (US East Coast). Usage and eCPM begin to spike on Thanksgiving, so lean into it!
2. **Add Ad Serving Logic -** All networks bid on a recency model that assumes users have less attention after every impression. If you’re serving 6 Rewarded Ads on average, it becomes more valuable at some points to show an interstitial instead of a Rewarded ad.
3. **Add Temporary Interstitials** - For this weekend only, add one or two extra interstitial placements to capture additional revenue.\
4. **Lower Banner Refresh Rate** - Reduce the refresh rate from 15 or 20 seconds to 5 or 10 seconds.

Increasing Demand:

Once you have optimized your supply, make sure you are not blocking high-value demand.

1. **Update app-ads.txt and Info.plist** - Boring yet powerful advice. More than 60% of the demand from most networks comes from resellers. If you don’t update this list, they can’t bid on your inventory! Update them now!
2. **Check Your CMP** - Another Boring Yet Powerful Piece of Advice. If your Consent Management Platform is not functioning correctly, Google treats every user as if they have not opted in. That means no targeted ads and lower eCPMs.
3. **Test Bid Floors -** Start small and test**:**

   1. **Banners**: US test a $0.01-$0.03 bid floor. RoW test only $0.01
   2. **Interstitials**: 7-10% of average eCPM in the US, 5-6% of average eCPM in Tier 1, around $0.20-0.50 cents in Tier 3
   3. **Rewarded Ads**: Set a bid floor at 10-15% of the average eCPM rate in the US, but use fallback logic to display interstitials if the Rewarded fill fails.
4. **Update Network Placements -** Some networks push more demand for 24 to 36 hours after a new placement is created. Some publishers update placements around **3 PM New York time on November 27**, just before the usage spike begins. Don’t overdo this, though, as you can get in trouble.

That is your Black Friday Ad Monetization playbook. You only get one weekend where both eCPMs and player engagement peak, so make sure you do it right! Happy Holidays!
