Back in February 2025, I reported in [Newsletter #9](https://felixbraberg.substack.com/p/the-mobile-ad-monetization-newsletter-d56?utm_source=publication-search) that **44 Vietnamese studios** had crossed **1 million downloads** in the past 30 days. Fast forward just five months, and that number has surged to **72**. That’s a **64% jump in less than half a year.**

Beyond the headline download surge, two meta-trends are starting to shape Vietnam’s gaming ecosystem:

**1. IAP revenue is taking off.**  
Leading studios aren’t just relying on Ad revenue anymore. They’re also scaling their IAP monetization. OneSoft’s IAP revenue grew **22%** in the past five months, while iKame saw a staggering **417% increase ($2.9m in February to $15m in July)**. This signals a shift from purely ad-driven growth toward deeper IAP monetization models.

**2. New studios are flooding in.**  
The ecosystem is also rapidly expanding. Between July and August alone, **58 entirely new Vietnamese studios** appeared in the download charts. These are studios that had recorded *zero downloads just a month earlier, according to Sensor Tower*.

Looking at Sensor Tower’s top 25 publishers by downloads in the past 30 days:

* **OneSoft** is now the **#3 studio worldwide**, trailing only Miniclip and Azure Games.
* **XGame** ranks **#12**, just behind Embracer and Garena.
* **iKame** sits at **#20**, less than **50k downloads** shy of Electronic Arts.

So what does all this tell us? Vietnam is no longer just growing fast; it is breaking into the big leagues and has started to go downstream and generate IAP revenue. Multiple studios are scaling downloads and monetization at a pace most Western publishers can only dream of. And if this is what five months looks like, the real question is not if Vietnamese studios will challenge the industry’s giants; it is how soon.

Turkish studio **Grand Games** is quietly scaling its second hit. **Car Match** has already reached **130k dollars a day** in revenue, split between **100k in IAPs** and **30k from ads**.

On the surface, it looks like another puzzle game, but it comes with noticeably higher production values. Players place cars on a “bench” and match three of the same to clear them, with cute Pixar-style cars modeled after classic vehicles. The puzzles incorporate mechanics such as tunnels, garages, and keys. Difficulty ramps slowly, with the first 50 levels designed to be impossible to lose, before the pace picks up with levels that can be cleared in as little as 15 seconds.

Around that core loop, Grand Games has layered a familiar meta game template. Car Match features a battle pass, a Streak Race mini game, daily quests, a Mission Garage, and a Canyon Road challenge, which suggests the studio is leaning on a proven playbook to extend engagement and monetization.
