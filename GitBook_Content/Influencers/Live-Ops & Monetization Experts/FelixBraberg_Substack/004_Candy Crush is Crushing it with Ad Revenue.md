What has long frustrated me is having epic discussions with various Game Designers about how ads ruin a mobile game and don’t make sense. I always find myself talking about Candy Crush and how they are crushing it with both rewarded ads and Interstitials.

According to Sensor Tower, Candy Crush has about **26 million Daily Active Users worldwide and 2.7 million users in the United States**. According to my estimates, Candy Crush should generate **between $580,000 and $610,000 per day in ad revenue, or just over $200 million per year.**

Candy Crush can achieve this by **segmenting** its users and only showing ads to players it is confident will never convert to in-app purchases. It is one of the cleanest examples in mobile where ads complement the economy rather than compete with it.

So let’s take a look at Candy Crush’s Rewarded Ad Placements. What makes them so effective is that each placement is tied to a natural moment in the player loop and gives a reward that fits the context of play.

## **Candy Crush Segmentation**

Now we get to the segmentation part, which is by far the most interesting piece. Unfortunately, this is where we have to move from the world of confirmed fact into the world of educated speculation and industry gossip. What I have heard through the grapevine is that Candy Crush leadership has been slowly expanding ad placements whenever they **see incremental uplift with no negative impact on the economy**. The word on the street is that King focuses heavily on showing ads only to users who show no purchase intent. That decision seems to be driven mainly by **three signals:**

* **Country-level purchasing patterns**. If a user comes from a region that historically spends very little on in-app purchases, they are more likely to be placed into an ad-enabled segment.
* **No purchase during the early spend window**. If a user goes through the early game and does not purchase within the first typical conversion window, they are treated as long-term non-payers.
* **UA partner purchase history**. King elledgy asks UA DSPs to flag whether the users they deliver have made prior purchases in their databases, and uses that as an additional signal for whether to show ads (heard this late night at PGC, so take it with a grain of salt).

Looking in from the outside, it is tough to estimate the actual ad viewer rate or IMP per DAU in Candy Crush. Still, the app-level estimates I used below paint a clear picture. With 26 million DAU, the scale is undeniable. In some regions, I would not be surprised if the ad view rate pushes well above seventy percent. Once you have effective segmentation in place, unlocking ads for a massive user base stops being a controversial decision and becomes an obvious LTV unlock.

I am not saying Royal Match is suddenly going to roll out Rewarded ads across the entire game tomorrow. But at some point, the industry will have to acknowledge the simple truth: the lowest-hanging fruit in any mature title is monetizing the non-paying audience. Candy Crush already proved how powerful that can be.

I do not usually spend much time discussing creatives and their impact on UA performance, but the last Creative Trends episode we recorded with 2.5 Gamers was a real eye-opener. We have been discussing fake creatives for years, yet it feels like a new era has arrived: **the era of creative theft.** We were looking at creatives for *Top Tycoon by Solitaire Farm*, and they are openly running ads lifted from completely different games and categories. Some even still have the original watermark. They are taking whatever performs, regardless of genre, context, or ownership, and pushing it into their UA mix, **and no one seems to care or notice!**

Is this a creative strategy that can win in the long run? Check out the episode to learn more!

*I have been getting a lot of messages asking me to bring back the “Cinderella of the Week” segment. I promise I check every single week, but sometimes there simply is no Cinderella to be found!*
