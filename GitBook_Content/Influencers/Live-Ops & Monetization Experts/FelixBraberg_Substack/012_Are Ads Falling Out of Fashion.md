Habby’s latest release, ***Wittle Defender,*** **earns less than 12%** of its revenue from ads. Rollic’s newest puzzle hits, *Knit Out* and *Hole People*, come from a studio once entirely dependent on ads, **yet now see less than 20% of revenue from IAA**. Even Vietnamese developers, historically reliant on ad-only strategies, are shifting aggressively toward IAP-first approaches. One has to ask… Are ads falling out of favor?

A few years ago, flooding your game with interstitials and rewarded ads was the solid strategy to reach fast revenue. But things have changed. Rising user acquisition costs, stricter privacy rules, and player fatigue from longer end cards have pushed studios to prioritize long-term retention and deeper monetization. With IAP, the payoff might take longer, but the revenue is more stable, scalable, and less reliant on volatile seasonality from eCPMs.

Despite the shift, ads still play a significant role, but not all formats contribute equally. **Interstitials account for roughly 50%** of all ad revenue in mobile games. **Rewarded video accounts for approximately 35%**, while banners comprise the remaining 15%. It’s a clear sign of where user attention and monetization potential lie. Interstitials still dominate because of their sheer volume, while rewarded ads are more user-friendly but less frequent. **Banners, once a staple, now at 5-second refresh rates barely move the needle**.

Another factor behind the shift is the industry's transition to bidding-only ad stacks. While bidding has brought transparency and simplified operations, it’s also led to **lower overall eCPMs** for many developers. The days of lucrative fixed-price deals and inflated waterfall CPMs are all behind us. With everyone competing in the same real-time auction, margins have tightened, especially for studios that once relied on negotiated network deals to boost ad revenue. The result? Ad ARPDAUs have plateaued or declined, prompting more studios to turn to IAP for growth.

Everyone talks about moving from ads to IAP. However, very few manage to achieve this. It is not just a switch you flip. It requires rewriting how your game is designed, how your users are segmented, and how your teams think about monetization. The studios winning right now are not the ones abandoning ads. They are the ones who ads show in their games and segment users based on various factors. The new blueprint is more comprehensive, slower-paced, and more complex to replicate.

That said, eCPMs may be entering a quiet renaissance. With platforms like AppLovin leaning heavily into e-commerce demand, think Temu, Shein, and Amazon-backed campaigns, ad rates are starting to climb again in certain pockets of the USA. However, this will also increase UA costs for game studios in turn. AppLovin is expected to roll out its e-commerce product globally before the end of the year, which could shift the economics once again, making ads a more profitable revenue stream, not just a fallback. Time will tell…

# **💰Great Content 💰**

2.5 Gamers is back with the second episode in our series exploring the world’s largest mobile app companies and how they operate. This week, we take a deep dive into Bending Spoons, the Milan-based powerhouse behind more than 500 million downloads and an estimated $500 million in annual revenue. Their model? Acquire underperforming apps, completely rebuild them, and hold indefinitely. Think of it as private equity meets product-driven tech, but they never sell their assets.

# **🎯The Cinderella of the Week🎯**

*Miracles still happen! Despite the highly competitive landscape in mobile, solo developers can still scale their IAA monetized games to impressive levels. This section is to salute you. Why? Because everyone loves a Cinderella story… that’s why.*

Did you know that the movie *The* *Blair Witch Project*cost $200,000 (1999) to make, and it grossed over $248 million at the box office? *Paranormal Activity (2007)* had a budget of $15,000 and grossed $194 million. It turns out that horror can be made on a small budget, scare people, and do exceptionally well financially.

Games are the same. Typically, horror games perform better on PC than on mobile, as the screen is significantly smaller. The *Granny* series by *DVloper* is the exception. Granny 1, 2, and 3 have collectively been downloaded 825 million times on mobile since 2018. What’s even more impressive is that *DVloper* is a one-person studio where all development work, level design, and music is made by himself.

The *Granny* games are all designed around escaping a house by finding various objects within it without being killed by Granny before five days pass. Every time you’re killed, 1 day passes. Each run, the location of the objects you need to escape changes, making the game very replayable.

Granny monetizes entirely from interstitial ads that appear between days when you get killed. Using the game play time and sessions per day from Sensor Tower, that would mean in the last 30 days, the Granny series horror game could have generated as much as $50k/day from its 3.7m DAU, however, out of all the ads that I saw while playing the game, all the ads were from Ironsource. Also, I can’t find any links to the app-ads.txt files. If there’s only one network serving ads, this number is likely closer to $15-19k/day. Still a Cinderella story nonetheless. However, always remember to add multiple networks.
