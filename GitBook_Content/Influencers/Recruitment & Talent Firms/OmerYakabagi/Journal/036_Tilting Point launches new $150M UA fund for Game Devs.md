This is the company’s third major UA fund, following similar initiatives in 2016 and 2018. Early beneficiaries include Mythical Games, Begin, and a soon-to-launch web-based gaming hub.

“With over 200 successful games, we’ve seen firsthand how impactful our UA funds can be,” said Tilting PointCEO Kevin Segalla. “It’s a powerful tool, letting developers scale efficiently while keeping their capital focused elsewhere.”
CBO Asi Burakadded: “We pioneered this model, and its strength lies in truly flexible, unlimited spending—while ensuring developers stay in the driver’s seat. Investing in promising games isn’t just part of our strategy; it’s how we build lasting partnerships.”
