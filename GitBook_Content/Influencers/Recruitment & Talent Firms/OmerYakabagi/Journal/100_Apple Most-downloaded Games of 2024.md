As 2024 ends, Apple has revealed the most downloaded games and apps in the U.S.
You can find the year-end charts on the App Store’s Today tab for iPhone and iPad. These charts highlight the top Apple Arcade games and the most popular free and paid apps and games. This list follows the 2024 App Store Awards announced last week.
It’s interesting to see a mix of new games and long-time favorites, like Monopoly Go, Roblox, Minecraft, Royal Match, Subway Surfers, Stardew Valley, and Among Us.
