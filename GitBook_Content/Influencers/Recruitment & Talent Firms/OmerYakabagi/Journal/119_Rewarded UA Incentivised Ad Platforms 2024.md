# Rewarded UA: Incentivised Ad Platforms 2024

**Source:** https://www.gamigion.com/rewarded-ua-incentivised-ad-platforms-2024/

A big shoutout toPaul Bowenfor writing on this topic! Cool to collaborate 🙂
We’re tracking a new company launch every week at this point. Especially gift card reward apps.
What’s causing the explosion of incentivized/rewarded UA channels recently?Is it because IDFA deprecation killed other channels? Or is it because advertisers are seeing great results from these channels? Or something else?
Paul’s main hypothesis is that most other ad formats have incumbents that dominate the 3rd party supply meaning there’s little innovation available for new entrants.
Rewarded video
Banners
Display
OEM
These are all 2-Sided marketplaces that are nearly impossible for startups to compete in.However, rewarding players for playing games is a 1-Sided marketplace. Once you’ve created value for the advertiser, you’ve got a viable business.
The benefit for these new entrants is that demand is far more transactional (Easier to win) than supply in mobile UA.
