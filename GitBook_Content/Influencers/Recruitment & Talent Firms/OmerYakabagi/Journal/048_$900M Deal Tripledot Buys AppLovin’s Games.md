Machine Zonefor $500M in 2020.
PeopleFunfor$100M in 2018.
Not even talking about Lion Studios, ZenLife, Magic Tavern, Belka Games, Clipwire, Athena Studio, and Leyi Games. Pretty bigover there.

Since 2018, AppLovin hasspent over $2 billion on 16 acquisitions.Half of that was on Adjust, but most of the acquired companies were gaming studios. Not every deal likely created value, but as a whole, it strengthened AppLovin as an ecosystem, and inorganic/acquisitive growth became a major driver. Here are theSubsidiaries of AppLovin Corp.
Tripledot, valued at$1.4 billion, specializes in addictive hits likeSolitaire&Woodoku. The deal,$500M in cash, $400M in equity, is expected to close by Q2, pending final agreements. If funding falls short, AppLovin will step in to finance the sale itself.
Let’s break it down real quick. Tripledot is valued at $1.4B, sitting on $500M cash and planning its first acquisitions in Q2.
If its EBITDA/EV ratio is 35%, does that mean Tripledot is undervalued? Maybe missing something here, how come with $500M in cash end up with a $1.4B valuation?
Tripledot was named the fastest growing company in Europe by Financial Times. Tripledot studios was named #1 in the highly respected “Financial Times 1,000 fastest growing companies in Europe, 2023”.
