After a turbulent period, the industry is finding its footing again—driven by evolving monetization strategies and AI-powered personalization.
Global Gaming App installs rose by 4% YoY in 2024, with emerging markets leading the charge. LATAM saw a 9% increase in installs, while MENA followed closely with 7%.
Hyper-casual games dominated install share at 27%, though they struggled with retention, while strategy games surged with an impressive 83% install growth.
AI is also reshaping user acquisition, helping developers fine-tune their ad strategies for better engagement.
“After a period of market volatility, mobile gaming is back on a growth trajectory,” says Tiahn Wetzler, director of content and insights at Adjust. With mobile-first adoption booming in LATAM and MENA, studios that focus on long-term player relationships over short-term gains stand to benefit the most.
