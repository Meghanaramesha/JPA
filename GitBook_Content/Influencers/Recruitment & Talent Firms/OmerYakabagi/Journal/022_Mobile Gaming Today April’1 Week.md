**Source:** https://www.gamigion.com/mobile-gaming-today-april1-week/

Hey Fam,
Was Ramadan Festival week!
I had the best time playing Mo-co, Squad Busters & Brawl Stars with my nephews!
Lots of laughs & sweet moments all around (:

»Helping Your Players In a Smart Way 🌿
Top puzzle games know the secret: support players, even if it means less short-term cash.
From Royal Match’s smart propeller targeting to Toon Blast’s clean levels, these subtle touches help players win without feeling squeezed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Royal Match’s “take a look” before end-game offers might lower conversions, but it builds trust. These aren’t just kind gestures; they’re smart, player-first design that drives long-term loyalty and revenue.
And it’s not just puzzles. A helpful AI or clear progression works wonders in any genre. Quick wins are easy, but great games play the long game by making players feel good.
