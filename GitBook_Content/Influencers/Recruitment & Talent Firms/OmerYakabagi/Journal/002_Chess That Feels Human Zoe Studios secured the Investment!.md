Looks really good. But you know, it always looks great, before all. 😅
Even their funding round was about smart money from people who believe in the vision, not just the numbers.
The game is still in Dev, but the positioning is already clear.  👇🏻Casual chess. Built for humans.
It can’t be about beating Chess.com (100% addict here, pretty bad)
We’re talking about something innovative, unique. Kinda rethinking chess for modern mobile habits.

Ever thought of trying chess but bounced off because it felt just too complex, off somehow?
They’re exactly targeting that audience. Curious players, casual gamers, and anyone who wants smart fun without the pressure.
This is not a hardcore Elo grind or a sterile board with timers screaming at you. Zoe’s goal is simple and powerful: remove intimidation, keep the brainy part, and make chess feel welcoming, warm, and easy to come back to every day.
Less “Pro Strategy”, More “I Belong Here”
Zoe Studios believes chess should feel good to open. Not like homework. Not like a test.
Through thoughtful design, pacing, and tone, they want chess to feel emotionally engaging, not scary or elitist. When done right, chess stops being just about moves and starts being about connection and habit.
For mobile players, especially experienced mobile gamers, this means a game you can relax with, learn naturally, and actually stick to.
