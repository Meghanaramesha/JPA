Adjust Faces Layoffs Amid Leadership Changes
Adjust just laid off 40% of its workforce.
Adjust, the mobile app measurement and marketing firm acquired by AppLovin in April 2021, is undergoing significant changes, including staff layoffs and leadership restructuring.

Reports of layoffs at Adjust have surfaced across social media, although specific details regarding the number of employees or departments affected remain unclear. A WARN notice filed in California on November 13th indicated that AppLovin plans to lay off 120 employees. Additional filings suggest earlier layoffs, including 58 employees in October, 65 cuts in early October, and 61 layoffs in August. It is uncertain whether these layoffs are part of the same restructuring effort or separate rounds of job reductions.

AppLovin acquired Adjust in April 2021 in a deal valued at up to $1 billion. At the time, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi described the acquisition as a “major milestone,” highlighting Adjust’s real-time app solutions and its extensive global client base as key assets to accelerate growth. When the deal was finalized, Adjust had over 500 employees across 16 offices worldwide.
AppLovin’s most recent financial report for Q3 2024 showed a 39% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.2 billion, with net income up 300% to $434 million. Despite this financial growth, Adjust is navigating a period of internal restructuring.

Amid the layoffs, Adjust has appointed Andrey Kazakov as its new CEO, replacing Simon Dussart. Kazakov, who previously served as Adjust’s chairman, founded Acquired.io in 2017, a company later integrated into Adjust. Before his recent appointment, Kazakov worked at AppLovin as Vice President of Revenue for non-gaming operations.
In his new role, Kazakov emphasized a strategic shift toward building an “engineering-first” organization. He outlined plans to enhance Adjust’s marketing measurement platform (MMP) with advanced AI and automation capabilities, aiming to provide advertisers with a competitive edge in leveraging performance data.
“The MMP industry has stagnated in recent years,” Kazakov stated. “We are committed to expanding advertisers’ capabilities and delivering functional innovations to help them grow their businesses.”
These developments signal a pivotal moment for Adjust as it aims to redefine its strategic priorities under Kazakov’s leadership. While layoffs and organizational changes can be challenging, the company appears focused on adapting to an evolving mobile marketing landscape and remaining competitive in a fast-changing industry.
