Most Publishers saw a dip in downloads as UA budgets get slashed in September.
Higher CPI: Competition! E-commerce & Retail brands dominate the market with massive ad budgets, driving CPIs up & up.
Shifting User Attention: Holiday Shopping – yaaay! Black Friday & Amazon Prime Days sound cool, right? There we go with the drop in engagement with gaming ads.
Lower UA Budget: Q4 is mostly the lowest-budget quarter. Gaming advertisers feel the pinch, having to cut back on UA spending as costs peak.
Publisher Response: Many shift focus from new installs toretentionandmonetization, emphasizing in-game events and promotions.
However,TikTok and Metahave rolled out enhanced probabilistic matching features, and these new models are likely to drive ad spend up on these platforms in the coming months.
