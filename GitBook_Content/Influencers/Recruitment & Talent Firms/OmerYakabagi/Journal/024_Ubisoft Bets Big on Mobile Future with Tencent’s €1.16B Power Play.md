This isn’t just about repackaging blockbusters.

With Tencent’s expertise in free-to-play and mobile gaming, the partnership accelerates Ubisoft’s pivot to accessible, global-first content that resonates across devices and markets, especially in fast-growing regions like Asia.
As CEO Yves Guillemot put it, “This is a foundational step in building strong, evergreen game ecosystems. We’re creating the conditions for long-term growth and redefining how players connect with our worlds—anytime, anywhere.”
The Subsidiary: Autonomous, Agile & Global
Headquartered in France, the new unit brings together top-tier Ubisoft teams from Montréal, Quebec, Barcelona, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, and Sofia.
