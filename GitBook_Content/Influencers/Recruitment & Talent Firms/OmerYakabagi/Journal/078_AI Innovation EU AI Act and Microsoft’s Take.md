Last week, the first provisions of the European Union AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive AI regulation, went into effect.

The AI Act extends beyond the EU—it applies to companies that operate in countries that place AI products on the EU market or produce AI systems whose outputs are used in the EU. Microsoft has been involved in dialogue with EU regulators from the AI Act’s earliest stages, and we continue to engage with regulators to share our insights, seek clarity on open questions, and advocate for practical outcomes. Below, we go into more detail on how we and our customers can innovate in line with the EU AI Act.
Building Microsoft products and services that comply with the EU AI Act
Organizations around the world use Microsoft products and services for innovative AI solutions that empower them to achieve more. For these customers, particularly those operating globally and across different jurisdictions, regulatory compliance is extremely important. This is why, in every customer agreement, Microsoft has committed to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Microsoft. This includes the EU AI Act.

Our framework for guiding engineering teams building Microsoft AI solutions—theResponsible AI Standard—was drafted with an early version of the EU AI Act in mind.
Building on these foundational components of our program, we have devoted significant resources to implementing the EU AI Act across Microsoft. Cross-functional working groups combining AI governance, engineering, legal, and public policy experts have been working for months to identify whether and how to update our internal standards and practices.
For example, as the EU AI Act’sprohibited practices provisionsbecame among the first provisions to go into effect on February 2, 2025, we have taken a proactive, layered approach to compliance that includes:
Conducting a thorough review of Microsoft-owned systemsalready on the market to identify any places where we might need to adjust our approach.
Creating new restricted usesin our internal company policy to ensure Microsoft doesn’t design or deploy AI systems for uses prohibited by the EU AI Act.
Updating our contracts,including ourGenerative AI Code of Conduct, so that our customers clearly understand they cannot engage in any prohibited practices.
Working with customersto help them deploy and use Microsoft products and services in compliance with the EU AI Act .
One of the core concepts of the EU AI Act is that obligations need to be allocated across the AI supply chain. This means that an upstream regulated actor like Microsoft must support downstream regulated actors, like our enterprise customers, when they integrate a Microsoft tool into a high-risk AI system. We embrace this concept of shared responsibility and aim to support our customers with their AI development and deployment activities by sharing our knowledge, providing documentation, and offering tooling. This all ladders up to theAI Customer Commitmentsthat we made in June of last year to support our customers on their responsible AI journeys.
