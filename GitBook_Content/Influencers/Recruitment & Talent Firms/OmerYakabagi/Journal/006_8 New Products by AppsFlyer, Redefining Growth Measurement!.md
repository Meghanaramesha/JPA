“Now, in the AI era, we’re empowering them to go beyond optimisation, to achieve truly autonomous growth.”
1. Incrementality for UA
Prove true lift in User Acquisition.
Set up cross-network incrementality tests in minutes, no heavy-lifting or manual work required
Quantify incremental growth across Meta, Google, TikTok, and more in one dashboard
Optimize spend with confidence using verified incremental insights
This is the scientific answer to “what is actually working.”
Instead of guessing which channel drives incremental users, you get real geo-based lift experiments across networks, done automatically, and polished enough to save teams weeks of data science work.
Spoiler: the true lift is often way higher than classic attribution suggested.
2. Agentic AI Suite
Your new AI co-pilot here?
This is the execution layer where marketers plug in tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, or VS Code and tap into clean, structured, privacy-safe data.
You can build your own agents or use AppsFlyer’s pre-built ones to hunt creative opportunities, highlight daily insights, and automate repetitive work.
The highlight:MCP (Marketing Command Prompt).Lets you ask your data anything in plain language. No SQL. No BI dependency. No pain.
Agents even spot top creatives on one network and push them to others automatically.Think “AI intern” that doesn’t need coffee breaks.

This unified view also becomes fuel for AI.Smart data in. Smart insights out. Adam Smart in.
4. Signal Hub
Goodbye signal loss…
Mastercard Data!• Use real purchase data to target players who already spend on similar games or correlated products.• Examples: target real casino spenders for social casino, target pizza buyers for a pizza game.• Works across all purchase types (app stores, retail, categories).• Huge boost for soft launches when studios lack first-party data.• Stronger retargeting and suppression by matching device IDs with Mastercard data.• Higher retention, LTV, and ROAS thanks to hyper-relevant users.
Marketing Breakthrough here.• Cross-industry data collaboration is now possible: banks x gaming, travel x fintech, ecommerce x fashion.• Companies can both use and monetize their data in a privacy-safe way.• Users will see fewer irrelevant ads and more genuinely useful ones.
The Road Ahead?• AI will optimize unused inventory and reduce ad waste.• Expect rapid iteration, bugs, and AB tests at the start, but long-term this becomes the new targeting standard.
Built for a world of missing identifiers and fragmented data. AppsFlyer plugs into world-class partners (starting withMastercard) to bring real-world behavioral signals into a privacy-safe clean room.
You combine your first-party data with these signals to build laser-precise audiences before they install.
Imagine targeting “people who spend heavily on your competitor but never touch your product” in two clicks.
Reach high-value users with real spend data
Enrich your audiences with anonymized purchase signals from leading platforms
Activate at scale across Meta, Google, TikTok, and more – with no setup required
Measure full-funnel impact from installs to revenue in one AppsFlyer dashboard
5. My Dashboards: your AI Analytics assistant

Future update: you’ll be able to create charts inside the AI chat and drop them directly into your dashboard.

Query in plain language and get instant answers with the embedded AI assistant
Cut reporting time in half as teams and executives access insights directly without analyst dependencies
6. Creative Management Hub
Your automated creative flywheel.
Creative Optimization and Automation: The New Meta
• Creative is officially the top performance lever. If you want to beat the algorithm, you beat it with better creatives.• AI is now the multiplier. Faster output, cheaper production, smarter iterations.• The new creative stack runs on three pillars:
SSOTlinking upper funnel to retention and cohort data.
Creatives → Dataso you can extract insights instead of guessing.
Automationto keep the creative flywheel spinning at scale.
How to Win Today
• Build for your audience first.• Let data drive every iteration.• Treat the creative cycle like a machine and let AI handle the heavy lifting.
The Future
• AI video, image, and gameplay generation are still early but will redefine production.• The long game is combining network optimization with brand, story, and human creativity.• Automation is no longer optional. If you don’t adopt it, your competitor already will.
Production isn’t the bottleneck anymore; measurement is. This hub ingests creatives, scores them pre-flight, breaks them into components, and gives AI-powered improvement suggestions before they even hit the networks.
It then deploys them automatically to Meta, Google, and more.
The long-term vision: these insights go back into generative models (Sora, etc.) to create new optimized variations on autopilot.
Central Hub to manage all creatives
Organize every creative in one hub for full visibility across running and planned assets
Prioritize top performers with AI-powered pre-flight scoring to focus on what works
Activate across networks in one click with automation, minimizing manual work and errors

8. Enhanced Attribution Model
AI-powered behavioral checks catch click flooding in real time.Cleaner data. Fairer credit. More accurate insights.
The Big Picture
AppsFlyer is clearly stepping into a new chapter. Not a “point solution,” but an engine forautonomous, data-rich, privacy-first marketing. Over 15,000 brands already rely on them, and this release feels like the toolkit for AI-first marketers.
As Chief Product Officer Barak Witkowski says, these products have already been tested across industries worldwide, and the early wins are strong.
Rollout begins this fall, with some features live today.
