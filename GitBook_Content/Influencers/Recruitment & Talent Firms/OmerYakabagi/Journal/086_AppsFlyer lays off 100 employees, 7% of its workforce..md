After “AppLovin’s Adjust Layoffs“, now AppsFlyer’s turn.
CEO Oren Kaniel says the company will focus on AI and scalability as part of long-term growth plans.
Unicorn AppsFlyer is laying off 100 of its employees, about 7% of its workforce. The company currently employs 1,200 people, two-thirds of whom are based in Israel. The layoffs will affect employees both in Israel and in the company’s other global offices. AppsFlyer was founded in 2011 by Oren Kaniel and Reshef Mann. According to estimates, the company’s revenue is currently around $400 million, and the layoffs may be part of preparations for a planned IPO in the coming year.
AppsFlyer was founded in 2011 by Oren Kaniel and Reshef Mann. The company has developed technology that allows app owners to identify where their most profitable users originated from, such as a Google search, an ad on Facebook or X, direct email, an SMS message, a television campaign, and more. The company has made several acquisitions in recent years that expanded its product portfolio. In the last significant fundraising carried out by the company in 2020, it was valued at $2 billion. Among the investors in the Israeli company are General Atlantic, the Salesforce investment fund, the Goldman Sachs growth fund, Qumra Capital, DTCP, Pitango Growth, and Magma.

In a letter to employees, Oren Kaniel, the company’s CEO and co-founder, wrote: “I am writing to inform you of a difficult decision we have made to ensure we remain agile, innovative, and positioned for long-term success. As part of this step, we will be parting ways with approximately 100 team members – representing 7% of our workforce – colleagues and friends who have been integral to our success and the impact we’ve made together.
“As a people-centric organization, we carefully considered every aspect before making this decision, ensuring that it was made with deep thought and concern for everyone affected.”
