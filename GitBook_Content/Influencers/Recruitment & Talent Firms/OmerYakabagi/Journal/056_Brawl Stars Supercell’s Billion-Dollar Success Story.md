A Year of Growth Amid Industry Decline
2024 was a turbulent year for gaming. While global mobile game downloads hit a five-year low, Supercell’s revenue nearly doubled to €2.8 billion, with an EBITDA of €880 million. CEO Ilkka Paananen believes their cautious approach to growth has been key. “We’ve kept Supercell small and scaled slowly. That strategy seems to be working.”
Marketing: A Make-or-Break Factor
In today’s competitive landscape, marketing is everything. Aalto University game researcher Annakaisa Kultima notes that once negligible marketing budgets are now astronomical. Supercell spent a record €500 million on game promotion in 2024 alone, ensuringBrawl Starsstays visible in a crowded market.

A Free-to-Play Giant That Prints Money
Surprisingly, 80% ofBrawl Starsplayers never spend a dime. The game’s revenue model thrives on microtransactions from a fraction of its massive player base, with licensed characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Godzilla adding to its appeal.
From Decline to Rebirth
A few years ago,Brawl Starsseemed to be losing momentum. However, Keienburg’s team revitalized the game, proving their ability to adapt and innovate. “Even though we’re part of a big company, our team operates like a small studio. I think players can feel that,” he says.
In an industry facing uncertainty, Supercell stands as a rare beacon of sustained success.
