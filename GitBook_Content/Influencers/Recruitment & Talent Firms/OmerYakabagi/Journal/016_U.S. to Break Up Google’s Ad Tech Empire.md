# U.S. to Break Up Google’s Ad Tech Empire

**Source:** https://www.gamigion.com/u-s-to-break-up-googles-ad-tech-empire/

The U.S. Department of Justice just dropped a bombshell: they want Google to break apart its ad tech business, starting withAdX&Google Ad Manager.
Filed in court Monday, the DOJ’s proposal aims to dismantle what it calls a“decade-long campaign of exclusionary conduct.”A judge already ruled Google’s ad dominance violates antitrust law. Now the DOJ wants action.
The Plan:
AdX must go — fast.The DOJ says AdX has made it hard for publishers and advertisers to switch to rivals and wants it soldASAP.
Google would also bebanned from running an ad exchange for 10 years.
Google Ad Manager/DFP would be split off in phases.First: Google must build an API for third-party integration and offer a full data export tool.Then: Open-source the ad auction code — and permanently block Google from using it again across Chrome, Android, DFP, etc.Finally: Sell off the rest of DFP to acompletely separatebuyer.

The DOJ also wants Google barred from using first-party data fromSearch, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, and Androidto boost its ad advantage.

Google’s Pushback:
Naturally, Google isn’t going quietly. It says it acquired AdX and DFP legally, and that splitting them up isn’t just hard, it’s afive-year engineering nightmare. According to Google, rebuilding these tools outside its ecosystem would drain resources and hurt customers.
Instead, Google is offering limited reforms:
Let rivals access AdX’s real-time bids.
Drop policies that block sharing bid data.
Kill unified pricing rules (UPR).
Keep the retired First Look and Last Look tools in the grave.
But the DOJ isn’t backing off — especially with aseparate antitrust casestill in progress, where it’s asking the court to make Googlesell off Chrometoo.
Bottom Line:
Google’s ad tech dominance is under full-on siege. If the DOJ gets its way, it could be thebeginning of the endfor Google’s ad empire as we know it.
