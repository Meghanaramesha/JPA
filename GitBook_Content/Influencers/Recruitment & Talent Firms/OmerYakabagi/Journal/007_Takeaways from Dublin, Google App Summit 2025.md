⚡️Retention to Monetization:Long Journey
You know. The challenge there is to balance Revenue & Player Trust.
Was curious about how the industry people see it. Asked & Prepared for ya :))
Let’s hear from them! 🕺🏻
“Retention is Everything”“More value, same users. Nail retention, and everything else follows.”
Focus on LTV & Retention”“Bad ads kill trust. The best publishers are those who test new alphas relentlessly.”
“The Headache: Losing Control of the Stack”“Next year’s trend: Harmony. Keep bidders in sync, remove what doesn’t add value.”
“Segmentation is the Game-Changer”“Find your perfect mix: IAPs, Subscriptions & Ads working together.”
“Segment by Channel, Country, or Engagement”“Real optimization starts when you tailor monetization per segment.”
“Experiment Relentlessly”“Stay curious, test new things. That’s how we move the industry forward.”
“AI on Ad Monetization”“Picture this: Right ad, right time, right value. AI-powered rewarded ads are here.”
Data, Trends & Execution: Staying Ahead
What’s the pulse of the industry today? It’s all about agility, data mastery, and regional strengths.
“Data & Trends Rock”
“Türkiye’s Edge: Execution”“Turkish teams are fast, decisive, and deliver quality. It’s in the DNA.”
“THE Bigger Picture”“Dev, Analytics, Monetization, UA; they’re all connected. Think Ecosystem.”
The Future of Mobile Gaming
Innovation, Retention & Sustainable Growth.
“Next in EMEA: Tech & AI”“Funding is tighter, creativity is strong. The answer is deeper technical exploration.”
“Think Like Gen Z”“Fast, social, interactive. Not desktop on mobile. The future is alive, not static.”
“Retention: The True North Star”“Fix retention first, every other metric will follow.”
“AI-Driven User Segmentation”“Less noise, more nuance. Retention & LTV over raw revenue.”
For New Studios: Advice from the Field
For every fresh founder in Mobile Gaming 👇🏻
“Think Holistically”“Don’t box yourself just into UA or Monetization. Connect the dots across the ecosystem.”
“Always Measure Success”“Don’t guess what’s working; know it. Let the DATA guide you.”
