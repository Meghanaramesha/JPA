The deadline came, and Apple didn’t hesitate.
Over135,000 appsvanished from EU App Stores overnight, casualties of theDigital Services Act (DSA). The new rule? Developers must publicly list theiraddress, phone number, and emailto keep their apps live. No compliance, no app.
Apple made it crystal clear: as ofFebruary 18, 2025, any app without a verified“trader status”is gone. And they’re not coming back until developers cough up the required details.
While the DSA aims fortransparency, it’s hittingsmall and indie developersthe hardest. Many work from home, relying on a simple support email rather than sharing personal contact details. Now, they’re scrambling for solutions—virtual offices, coworking spaces, and burner numbers—just to stay compliant without sacrificing privacy.
The rule applies toany app that makes money—whether throughin-app purchases, ads, or even one-time downloads. Hobby projects? Exempt. But if you’re running an app like a business, the EU wants you toshow your face—or at least your business address.
Now, users can find this“trader info”nestled between an app’sage rating and supported languages—an extra layer of transparency for consumers.
Apple had beenwarning developers for months, so this massive takedown shouldn’t come as a shock. Still, the impact is undeniable. If you’re a dev with an EU audience and your app just disappeared, it’s time to update those details—or risk being left in the App Store graveyard.
