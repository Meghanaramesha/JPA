Hot stuff out here.
“Within the next 3 years, there will be so much AI, in particular AI video, people won’t know if what they see or hear is real.”— Mark Cuban
Welcome to the paradox of progress.
AI is exploding. Reality is imploding.
We’re not just living in the age of deepfakes — we’re living in the age ofdeep doubts. And when everything feels synthetic, theonlything that stands out is what’sreal.
That’s why Cuban calls it theMilli Vanilli effect— a callback to the music duo that lip-synced their way to fame… until the illusion collapsed. In a world of AI-generated faces, voices, and hype, the backlash is brewing.
The result?A new golden age of human connection.
Events, meetups, conferences, real-life experiences —they’re about to pop offlike never before. Forget endless Zoom fatigue and hyper-polished digital campaigns. People want sweat. Eye contact. Laughter that isn’t processed through a synthetic smile filter.
AI Will Win the Internet — But Lose the Room
“AI is eroding authenticity in every marketing channel besides one… Events will be the number 1 channel that sets brands apart.”— Mark Cuban
That’s the bet.And it’s a bold one.
Because as AI floods content pipelines —writing, designing, coding, selling, even acting— thescarcecommodity becomes human authenticity. The only thing AI can’t fake isyour actual presence.
In-person experiences?They’re the new premium.
Smart brands will shift spend. Event budgets will scale. Jobs will evolve. The marketers in offices will become field agents — creating unforgettable moments, not just CTRs.
Meanwhile, on the AI Frontier…
“We are past the event horizon. The takeoff has started.”— Sam Altman
On the other side of the coin, Sam Altman is laying out a vision that reads like a sci-fi prophecy — except it’s already happening.
We’re entering a decade where:
Agents do cognitive work.
Robots run supply chains.
Intelligence becomestoo cheap to meter.
And agentle singularitygradually rewrites what it means to work, create, and even think.
But here’s the twist:
Despite all this exponential progress — AIstillcan’t replace what makes us human.
It might write better than you. Paint faster. Sell smarter.But it will neverfeel. It will nevercare.And in a post-authenticity world, that’s exactly what people will crave.
The Collision Course: Altman’s Future vs. Cuban’s Countertrend
So what happens when we combine Cuban’s prediction and Altman’s acceleration?
We get a world whereAI does the heavy lifting, buthuman presence becomes the ultimate differentiator.
AI floods the digital realm.
Humans rise in the physical one.
Events, communities, relationships, handshakes —they gain cultural gravity.
You might have ChatGPT write your pitch. But you’ll still want to deliver itin person.You might have an AI assistant manage your calendar. But you’ll still go to that event toconnect, feel, and be seen.
Final Thought:
In an artificial world, human interaction wins.
The companies that bet on people, not just pixels, will dominate this next chapter.The creators whoshow upwill outperform those who just post.The brands that putreal skin in the gamewill earn real loyalty.
Call it a revival. Call it resistance.Call it the Milli Vanilli effect.Whatever you call it — it’s coming. And it’s gonna feelrealgood.
