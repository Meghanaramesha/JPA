Samsung Revolutionizes Mobile Gaming with 80/20 Revenue Share & Cloud Gaming Innovations
Samsung is shaking up the mobile gaming industry with a game-changing 80/20 revenue share model for games on theGalaxy Store. Announced just ahead of the Game Developers Conference, this move significantly undercuts Apple and Google’s standard 30% cut, aligning more closely with Epic Games’ developer-friendly 12% model.

Empowering Developers with Cloud Gaming
Samsung’s mobile cloud gaming platform is redefining how developers scale their businesses. By eliminating the need for downloads, the platform allows players to jump straight into gameplay, enhancing user acquisition, boosting revenue potential, and simplifying game development with an extensive suite of software development kits (SDKs) and tools.
Since launching commercially in North America in November 2024, Samsung’s cloud gaming service has already driven significant success. Take Vizor, the developer behindKlondike Adventures—since joining Samsung’s beta program in July 2024, they’ve seen millions of new players and a 25% increase in their 60-day return on ad spend (ROAS) compared to traditional campaigns.
A Seamless, High-Conversion Experience
Samsung’s cloud gaming solution transforms advertising into instant gameplay, eliminating friction for both publishers and players. “By converting an ad click directly into first gameplay, we’re increasing conversion rates and maximizing ad spend efficiency,” said Jong Woo, head of game services at Samsung.
For players, this means no more waiting for downloads—just instant, seamless fun. For developers, it’s a smarter way to reach new audiences and grow their games organically within the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem.

Next-Level Attribution for Cloud Gaming
Traditional mobile game attribution relies on app installs, but cloud gaming changes the rules. Samsung, in partnership with AppsFlyer, has pioneered a first-of-its-kind cloud-based attribution system that tracks ad clicks and subsequent gameplay, redefining what constitutes an install in the cloud era.
“Cloud gaming is transforming access to games, and attribution must evolve alongside it,” said Adam Smart, Director of Product, Gaming at AppsFlyer. This new approach allows developers to track in-game purchases and ad campaign effectiveness without requiring physical downloads.
More Revenue, More Opportunities
On May 15, 2025, Samsung’s 80/20 revenue share model will officially take effect, ensuring that developers retain a larger share of their profits. This model applies not only to Galaxy Store games but also to those built on Samsung’s cloud gaming platform, amplifying opportunities for game publishers.
With premium promotional support, direct distribution to millions of pre-loaded Galaxy devices, and cutting-edge cloud technology, Samsung is positioning itself as the ultimate partner for mobile game developers.
