Beatstar was launched globally in 2021 after five years of development within Space Ape Games by a team that includedSimon Hadeas COO and co-founder of the studio, andOlly Barnes, who led music strategy and rights acquisition.
Barnes is the co-founder of Voisey, a music-making app that Snapchat acquired for$70 millionin 2020. Snapchat later offloaded Voisey in 2022 as part ofSnap Inc.’s wide-scale restructuring.
Beatstar is a free-to-play mobile game often compared toGuitarHero. It features over850global music hits secured through music licensing deals with major labels, indie publishers, and dozens of rightsholders.
In September 2022,MBWreported that BeatstarsharedUSD $16 millionof its revenue with music labels and publishers in the first year since its launch.
Most recently, Hade and Barnes announced that Beatstar has amassed nearly100 milliondownloads and is expected to surpass$200 millionin lifetime revenue this year.
“Addressing this immense opportunity, now, with a dedicated music-focused venture rather than a traditional mobile gaming studio approach makes this partnership an exciting step forward for all concerned.”

“As soon as we played the first prototype of Beatstar we knew we had something special that could really break new ground. I look forward to building on the momentum of the talented Space Ape team, as NEXTBEAT, to expand into more experiences, games, and apps that showcase the inspiration and creativity of our artist partners,” said Hade.
“Addressing this immense opportunity, now, with a dedicated music-focused venture rather than a traditional mobile gaming studio approach makes this partnership an exciting step forward for all concerned and I’m thrilled that the team at Supercell shared our ambitious vision.”
The spinoff follows Supercell’s investment in Space Ape Games, which began with a$56 millionmajority stake purchase in 2017 and increased to75%ownership in 2022. While Supercell moves to acquire the remaining shares of Space Ape Games, it will maintain a minority position in NEXTBEAT alongside other external investors.
“Beatstar taught us that there is huge per-user monetization potential for music in gaming, far surpassing streaming service subscriptions.”

“Beatstar taught us that there is huge per-user monetization potential for music in gaming, far surpassing streaming service subscriptions. The vast mobile gaming audience and ARPU insights from Countrystar’s genre-focused approach underscored the need to launch a fully resourced company dedicated to this opportunity,” said Barnes.
Looking ahead, NEXTBEAT plans to develop additional genre-focused gaming platforms while exploring opportunities to apply its music licensing and game development expertise in educational technology and mental health sectors.
Supercell’s Chief Strategy OfficerJanneSnellmansaid, “We are excited to continue on the journey that started with Beatstar and see the next phase of music-first business alongside NextBeat’s talented team.”
