This newest iteration of the mixed object match pair puzzler is hitting the gas, overtaking even the previous leader of this loop.
Another testament to the quality setup of Hybrid Casual puzzler, powered by a unique core gameplay loop with very accessible gameplay and theme. On top of it, its metagame is using all of the best practices of the event rotation meta from Royal Match, making this a highly grossing combination.

In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI but left in 2018 due to a conflict of interest with his role at Tesla.
At first, it was an amicable split—until ChatGPT’s success changed everything. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, pivoted the company towards a for-profit model to secure new investments. Musk wasn’t thrilled. “We built this as a nonprofit and poured in billions under that premise,” he argued. When Altman didn’t back down, Musk sued OpenAI, claiming the move violated its original charter.

Musk just dropped a$97.4 billionall-cashofferto buy OpenAI—loaded withheavy conditions.Altmanclapped backon Twitter with a “NO, TY” vibe, thenpulledthe“How can a nonprofit sell shares?”card to call Musk’s bluff. Muskcounteredwith,“Keep it non-profit, or I’m out.”But before the drama could escalate, OpenAI’s board shut the offer down. A corporate soap opera straight out ofSuccession.
