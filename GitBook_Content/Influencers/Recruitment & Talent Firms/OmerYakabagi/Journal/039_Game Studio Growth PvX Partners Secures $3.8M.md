Scaling a game is all about timing. Studios with predictable marketing returns often hit a critical growth window, but traditional financing options come with trade-offs: slow bootstrapping, painful equity dilution, or risky debt.
PvX Capital changes the game with Cohort Financing, giving studios fast, flexible capital—up to $25M per year—while sharing downside risk. With term sheets in 24 hours and funds deployed within days, PvX has already helped gaming companies like Dabble, Top App Games, MysteryTag, and Playsome level up their user acquisition.
“As founders, we’ve faced this funding dilemma firsthand,” saidJoe Wadakethalakal, Co-Founder & CEO of PvX Partners.
“Studios with reliable marketing returns shouldn’t have to dilute ownership or take on risky debt just to grow. This is the model I wish I had—it blends equity flexibility with debt efficiency into a financing solution thatworks with founders, not against them.”
