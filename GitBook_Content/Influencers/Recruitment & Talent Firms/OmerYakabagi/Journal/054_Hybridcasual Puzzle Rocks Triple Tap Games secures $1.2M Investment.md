The Shift from Hyper-Casual to Hybrid-Casual
Hyper-casual games thrived on simplicity but lacked retention and monetization depth. Post-2020, rising user acquisition costs and changing player preferences spurred a pivot. Hybrid-casual games blend easy-to-learn mechanics with engaging progression, optimizing long-term retention and revenue.
Success stories likeSurvivor.io($200M+ revenue) andStumble Guys($100M+ revenue) prove that the model works. Yet, balancing accessibility with depth is a challenge only seasoned teams can master.
Why Triple Tap Games?
Led by Karan Khairajani, the team boasts a decade of success in gaming. At Firescore Interactive, they built hyper-casual hits (Soap Cutting,Acrylic Nails,Hair Dye) with 400M+ downloads, leading to an acquisition by Crazy Labs (6B+ downloads). Their expertise in game design, retention, and monetization positions them perfectly for hybrid-casual dominance.
The Future is Hybrid-Casual
Hyper-casual’s decline signals a need for deeper experiences. Triple Tap Games has the vision, team, and execution ability to capture this market and scale globally.
