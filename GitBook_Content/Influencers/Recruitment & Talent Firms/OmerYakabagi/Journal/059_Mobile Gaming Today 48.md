# Mobile Gaming Today: 48

**Source:** https://www.gamigion.com/mobile-gaming-today-48/

Hallo Fam,
Crazy how Hamburg is enjoying amazing weather this week while Istanbul is buried under snow! ☃️
Guess I should study Geography to make sense of it… or maybe it’s just global warming doing its thing, huh?
Game of the Week
🍭Candy Crush Solitaireby King
Having its global launch on Feb 6th, looking at the numbers the game did just $260K on 3M+ downloads. Doesn’t seem like the result King was looking for. Why? 🤔

Compared to competitors, and there are many, there is one major change in core gameplay, where players can store 1 extra card as another “connecting” card, instead of just linear connecting all the cards on the board. This gives them much more tactical gameplay ⚔️, where they can save this card for later when they run out of their current chain to immediately start the next one. Because of predominantly older female players, this seems like a step too far into the puzzle, strategic depth direction, which makes the game much more niche, as difficulty needs to be balanced around this additional “helping” mechanic.
Looking at the current state of top puzzlers, which are all following the cookie-cutter Royal Match event metagame, CC Solitaire has having much less aggressive approach. By level 50, I encountered around 2-3 events, whereas in the Royal Match 👑 events meta you are constantly bombarded 💣 by repeating a combo of 4 events that once completed reset again based on player progression. This is all done toward driving the player to play the main level saga as much as possible through use of very short timers, real-time competing players, or event objectives that are different than the level objectives.
