# Game Over for Sexist Mobile Ads

**Source:** https://www.gamigion.com/game-over-for-sexist-mobile-ads/

Mobile gaming’s fun, until the Ads get weird. And sexist. And downright disgusting.
The UK’s Advertising Standards Authorityjustdropped the ban hammeroneightmobile game ads that crossed a line—hard. Think: women as props, porn tropes masquerading as game previews, and disturbing depictions of coercion wrapped in cutesy animation. The ASA called it what it is:shockingandunacceptable.

🤯 Wait, This Is Still Happening?
Jup.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Despite progress in other media, mobile game ads are stuck in a grim loop of clickbait and sleaze.
Low CPI = Business as usual :))
They’re not edgy. GROSS.
And yet, they WORK.
That’s the problem :))
🚫 Misleading gameplay = player distrust
💔 Sexist content = alienating 48% of the mobile gamer base (yep, that many are women)
📉 Fake ads = 1-star reviews and high uninstall rates
A study on 50+ games using “Fake-vertising” showed a massive drop in user ratings when ads didn’t match gameplay, especially when they were exploitative.
This Isn’t About Censorship: Respect
From the infamousLily’s Gardenads to “harem sims” and NSFW dress-up games, mobile ad creatives are often less about gameplay and more about shock, drama, and misogyny. But it’s not necessary.

Games likeStardew Valley,Alto’s Adventure, andMonument Valleyprove you can win users without objectifying anyone. They lead with creativity, not clickbait.
🛠 So What Can We Do?
Reportsexist ads (Pain, but WORTH.)
Leave reviewsthat call out bad ad practices
Support devswith ethical ad strategies
Push platformslike Apple, Google, and TikTok to do better
Speak upin the industry, PLEASE, no silence.
This Isn’t Just a Game
Mobile gaming is massive, with 1.7 billion players worldwide.
We can’t let a few bad actors define the experience. It’s time to ditch the lazy, sexist marketing and build a future that respects all players.
