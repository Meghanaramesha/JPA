Backed by the powerhouse behind mobile juggernauts like Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, and the upcoming Squad Busters, Supercell Investments is renewing its mission to support the most ambitious game studios and game tech teams worldwide.
✅ What’snew:
Supercell Investments isn’t new, but this is the first time they’re publicly showcasing it in such a structured, open, and branded way.
The new website and refreshed branding are meant to make their mission, backed studios, and investment approach more transparent and accessible.
They’re actively inviting more founders to reach out, especially those outside typical hubs, without requiring relocation or sacrificing independence.
“We know that the best teams make the best games—and that great games can come from anywhere and anyone.”
Since its inception, Supercell Investments has backed some of the most creative, independent studios across the globe, providing capital, trust, and the freedom to build unforgettable games, without forcing relocation or stripping teams of their identity.
With this relaunch, Supercell aims to make its value proposition even clearer to founders: whether you’re building for mobile, PC, cross-platform, or cutting-edge game tech, Supercell wants to talk.

Supercell has been quietly backing top-tier studios (like Metacore, HypeHype, Channel37) with a “high trust, low interference” model.
This public move signals they’re scaling that strategy and looking to invest more actively across mobile, PC, cross-platform, and game tech.
They’re also leveraging their internal network of 1,000+ game pros and partners to help these teams grow, not just writing checks.
It’s a rare peek into how a top-tier mobile gaming giant invests strategically.
It breaks away from traditional VC playbooks, offering capital with autonomy.
It could signal more deals, more innovation, and more successful indie hits coming down the pipeline, especially in underserved regions.
“Now, we’re paying it forward, helping more teams create games that are played for years and remembered forever.”
Supercell’s investment legacy is rooted in its own journey, from its early VC supporters to strategic backers likeSoftbankandTencent. Now, it’s turning those lessons into a blueprint for the next generation of global game makers.
If you’re an ambitious team looking to redefine what great games or game tech looks like, this is your moment. Supercell wants to hear from you.
📢 Developers. Investors. Partners. Let’s build something unforgettable together.
