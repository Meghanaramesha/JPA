This acquisition is logical in the highly fragmentedPlay & Earn (P&E)ecosystem, which is experiencing unprecedented growth.
With 27 companies listed in theIncentivized Advertising Databaseoffering gift card reward services, consolidation is inevitable as larger players and their owners absorb smaller companies to expand their P&E portfolios. However, key questions remain, particularly around the total addressable market (TAM) for users interested in earning gift cards by playing games. I anticipate we’ll see further consolidation in the future as an answer to that question.

Mega Fortuna has achieved rapid success since its founding in 2023. Their flagship platform, Richie Games, has become a game-changer in mobile gaming by combining discovery with rewards. With over 10 million monthly active users, the platform allows players to earn real-world gift cards while exploring new games, revolutionizing user engagement.

The company was established by seasoned entrepreneurs Şeyhmus Ölker and Burak Göncü, who previously co-founded and led companies including App Samurai and POW Games. Mega Fortuna now employs 34 people, with a focus on technical expertise to power its unique rewards mechanism.
The deal comes hot on the heels of atotal €152 million growth investment in Aonicfrom Metric Capital Partners and Active Ownership, one of Europe’s largest minority growth equity transactions in 2024. This underlines the group’s ambitious plans for 2025 and beyond.
