Supercell justdroppedsome mind-blowing stats about Brawl Stars at GDC, and let’s just say, it’s been one heck of a ride.
Revenue soaring 8.8 times higher than last year, with MAU doubling to 2.4x – Talk about leveling up!?
But wait, it gets even better. Back in the day, early 2023, Brawl Stars hit a bit of a rough patch – retention and revenue were on the ropes. So, what did the Brawl team do? They went full-on superhero mode, tossing out loot boxes like yesterday’s news and rolling in with a slew of new features. We’re talking randomized rewards, special moves for the die-hard fans – the works!
And guess what? It worked like a charm! Revenue went from snoozeville to superstar status, shooting up by a jaw-dropping 8.8 times from June 2023 to February 2024. Plus, Brawl Stars stormed its way back into the top 20 grossing games, Top-20!
But that’s not all – MAU & DAU? They went through the roof, climbing 2.4 times and a whopping 3.9 times, respectively. Literally like Brawl Stars hit the turbo button and never looked back!
Thanks to these epic moves and player-powered upgrades, Brawl Stars isn’t just a game – it’s Supercell’s flagship adventure now. What a story!
