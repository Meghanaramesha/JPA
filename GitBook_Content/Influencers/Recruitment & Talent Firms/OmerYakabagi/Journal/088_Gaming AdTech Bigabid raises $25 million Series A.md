The round, led by MobilityWare, will fuel expansion and enhance ad-based gaming models.
Bigabid, a data-driven ad-tech company specializing in machine learning (ML) based solutions, has raised $25 million in a Series A round and signed a cooperation agreement with the gaming company MobilityWare to expand its media activity in the gaming sector. The company’s $3 million Seed round took place in 2016.
The company’s CEO, Amit Flohr, told Calcalist that Bigabid faced challenging years in its early stages, but now that it is profitable, it has decided to raise new capital. “MobilityWare and several leading angel investors participated in the round. We’ve had many offers to raise funds, but I didn’t want to dilute the shareholders. I was looking for an investment that adds strategic value, which makes the collaboration with MobilityWare especially important. The funds will also be used to strengthen our development team with key talent.”

Flohr added, “We are a data-driven company in the ad tech space. We’ve developed advanced technology that functions like a trading system for ad exchanges in the mobile advertising world. Our technology is now highly mature and has delivered strong results in recent years. We’re growing rapidly, doubling our revenue annually. We have a strong presence in the gaming industry and are deeply connected to it. Our platform excels at targeting the right ads to specific audiences. Since I joined about four and a half years ago, the company has grown from 20 employees to around 100.”
Bigabid was founded in 2015 by a group of entrepreneurs, including Amit Attias, the company’s CTO, and Ido Raz. The company has developed an advanced DSP (Demand Side Platform) for mobile performance marketing, delivering solutions for user acquisition (UA) and retargeting. The platform processes over 50 terabytes of data daily, analyzes 2 billion mobile devices per minute, and executes over 1 million predictions per second.
The latest investment will accelerate the development of next-generation machine learning models tailored for IAA-based gaming, enabling the company to improve targeting accuracy for specific player audiences. “We expect this expansion to create significant opportunities, potentially generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in the coming years. It reflects the company’s tremendous potential to continue leading the industry and offering cutting-edge technological solutions in the gaming and data markets,” said Flohr.
