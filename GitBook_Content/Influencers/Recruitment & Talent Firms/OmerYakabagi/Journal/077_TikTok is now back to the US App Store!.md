The Chinese social media platform is once again available for download in the US as Donald Trump deliberates its future amid ongoing security concerns.
Welcome back, old sport!
TikTok reappeared in Apple’s and Google’s US app stores on Thursday after President Donald Trump postponed a ban on the Chinese-owned social media platform and confirmed that the tech companies would not face fines for hosting or distributing it.

The widely-used short video app, which nearly half of all Americans engage with, briefly went offline last month before a law took effect on January 19. This law mandates that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, must either sell TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban.
The next day, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order delaying the ban’s enforcement by 75 days, allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US for the time being.
Although TikTok resumed service following Trump’s assurances, Apple and Google initially kept the app removed from their US stores. On Thursday, TikTok confirmed that its latest version was once again available for download.
Analysts suggest the delay may have been due to Apple and Google seeking confirmation that they wouldn’t face legal repercussions for distributing the app. Trump’s directive assured that the companies would not be penalized for keeping TikTok available.
According to market intelligence firmSensor Tower,TikTokwas the second-most downloaded app in the US last year, with over 52 million downloads. Of these, 52% came from Apple’s App Store, while 48% were from Google Play.

The law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US assets—or ultimately face a ban—was signed by then-President Joe Biden in April last year. The legislation stemmed from concerns over national security and fears that China could exploit the platform for surveillance on American users.
The US has never banned a major social media platform before, but the law grants the government broad authority to prohibit or force the sale of other Chinese-owned apps in the future.
On Thursday, Trump stated that the 75-day deadline on TikTok could be extended.
The uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future has drawn interest from potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt. Analysts estimate TikTok’s US operations could be valued at as much as $50 billion.
Trump mentioned that he was in discussions with several parties regarding TikTok’s purchase and expected to make a decision on the platform’s future by February.
