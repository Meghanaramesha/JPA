Take-Two Interactive released its report for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which spanned from October 1 to December 31, 2024. Here’s what it revealed.
▫️Take-Two reported net revenue of $1.36 billion, which is 1% lower than the previous year.
▫️Almost all revenue came from digital game sales—96% or $1.31 billion.
▫️The leading platform for Take-Two remained mobile, accounting for 54% of revenue. Console games contributed 37%, while PC and other platforms made up 9%.
▫️The total net bookings for the quarter rose by 3% to $1.37 billion.
▫️Losses couldn’t be avoided. During the quarter, Take-Two lost $125.2 million, a 36.6% increase compared to the previous year.
▫️Overall, the company is pleased with the quarterly results. Although the mobile division led by Zynga earned less than expected (mainly due to a downturn in the hyper-casual games segment), overall operational metrics surpassed the forecast.

▫️GTA+ subscribers increased by 10% compared to the previous year.
▫️Sid Meier’s Civilization VII set a series record for pre-orders. Take-Two did not disclose the number.
▫️Take-Two anticipates that 2025 will be one of the most outstanding years in the company’s history. In just four days, the full release of Sid Meier’s Civilization VII will take place, followed by the summer release of Mafia: The Old Country, the fall launch of GTA VI, and Borderlands 4 by the end of the year.
