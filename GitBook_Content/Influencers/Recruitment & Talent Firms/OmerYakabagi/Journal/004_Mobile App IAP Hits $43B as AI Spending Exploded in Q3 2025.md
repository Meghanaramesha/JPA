Non-games extended their lead with $22.3B, powered by AI. GenAI spend exploded from $400M to nearly $1.5B YoY, now 7% of all non-game revenue. Mobile games held steady at $20.9B, their second-best quarter ever.
Both stores grew fast. iOS rose 10% and kept its grip on non-game spend at 72%. Google Play jumped 14.5% and continues accelerating.
AI reshaped the revenue charts.
ChatGPT leaped from #16 to #2 globally, sitting right behind TikTok and hitting #1 in markets like Turkey, Brazil, Spain, and Canada. Downloads stayed stable at 37.6B, but non-game apps grew 5.5% while games declined. Google Gemini climbed 12 spots to #6 globally.
Emerging markets drove volume.
India crossed 6.5B downloads for its strongest quarter in two years, while Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Iraq, and South Korea all added 45M+ downloads YoY.
On the ad side, US digital spend grew 12%.
Gaming advertisers led the surge with a 28% QoQ jump. Shopping struggled due to tariff shocks, but Temu and SHEIN doubled spend late in the quarter. Auto insurance also spiked as prices and premiums rose.
The US remained the world’s top IAP market by a wide margin. Western Europe added nearly $800M, and Brazil stood out with a 29% revenue surge, the fastest among top 20 markets.
