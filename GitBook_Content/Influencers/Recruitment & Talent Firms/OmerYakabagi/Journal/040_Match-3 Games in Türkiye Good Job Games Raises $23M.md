As reported byVentureBeat, Good Job Games, a fast-rising Mobile Game Developer from Turkiye, has secured a massive $23 million in seed funding to cement its place as a major entertainment powerhouse.
The round was led by Menlo Ventures and Arcadia, the new gaming fund launched by Tripledot co-founder Akin Babayigit.

For a company founded in 2017, waiting eight years before raising external capital is unusual. But Good Job Games never needed outside investment—until now. Led by Ilker Ilicali and Nazim Akmandil, the company has thrived on its own momentum, quickly becoming a hypercasual gaming giant with over three billion downloads. It sold its hit game Zen Match and has since doubled down on revolutionizing the match-3 genre, with Match Villains leading the charge.
“We built Good Job Games without external funding, powered by our team’s passion and craftsmanship,” said CEO Ilker Ilicali. “Now, with Menlo and Arcadia as partners, we’re scaling to create genre-defining games with global appeal.”
The company boasts a 100+ person team, united by a culture of creativity and attention to detail. That dedication is evident in Match Villains, which Menlo Ventures’ Amy Wu calls the best match-3 game on the market after playing over 1,000 levels. Arcadia’s Babayigit agrees, citing its extraordinary long-term retention metrics.

Past Acquisitions
Good Job Games has previously been in the spotlight due to significant acquisitions:
In2022, the companysold its Zen Match game to Moon Active.
Two years ago, itshyper-casual games were acquired by AI Games FZ.
Hypercasual games require great ideas and execution—not massive resources. That was Good Job Games’ early strategy. But competing in match-3, a $10 billion market, demands substantial investment. “It’s time to scale, and bringing in the right partners is the best move,” Ilicali explained.
Turkiye’s game development ecosystem is surging, thanks to an abundance of top-tier talent. Ilicali credits Peak Games’ success (acquired by Zynga) for proving Turkiye’s global potential. “There’s a generation here that grew up immersed in Western entertainment, giving them strong instincts for what works globally,” he said.
Good Job Games is experimenting with AI but remains focused on human-driven game craftsmanship. Looking ahead, the company aims to propel Match Villains to a massive audience while continuing to innovate in mobile gaming.
With a track record of hits, an elite team, and now the backing of strategic investors, Good Job Games is set to leave a lasting mark on the industry.
