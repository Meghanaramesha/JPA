\*As far as I know (and after checking around) there’s no obvious connection between Com2uS and Habby — but I may be mistaken.

🚨 That’s why this cross-promo in Minion Rumble (Com2uS) caught my eye: it’s featuring Capybara Go!, which is published by Habby.  
  
Normally, cross-promotions stay within a publisher’s own portfolio. But here we see two different companies sharing real estate — which suggests either a partnership, a distribution deal, or just a smart test of mutual promotion.  
  
I like how this breaks the usual mold:  
✅ Expands reach beyond a single publisher’s ecosystem  
✅ Taps into overlapping audiences of casual players  
✅ Creates win-win visibility for both titles  
  
A nice reminder that in today’s crowded mobile space, collaboration beats isolation.  
  
👉 Have you seen other cases where publishers promote outside their own catalog?
