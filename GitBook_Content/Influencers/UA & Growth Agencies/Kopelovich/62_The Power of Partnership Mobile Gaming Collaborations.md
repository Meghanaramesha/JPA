**Welcome back to** ***The Power of Partnership*****, where we explore the boldest and most imaginative collaborations in mobile gaming.** In this edition, we’re spotlighting IP crossovers that range from viral meme madness and anime legends to sustainability-driven challenges that plant real trees. Whether it’s the world of *Naruto* arriving in *Mobile Legends* or *Skibidi Toilets*invading *Stumble Guys*, one thing’s clear—brand partnerships are getting bigger, bolder, and more meaningful than ever.

Let’s dive into the latest round of collabs that are shaping how players engage with their favorite games and franchises.

### MONOPOLY GO! x Star Wars

From May 1 to July 2, MONOPOLY GO! takes a leap to a galaxy far, far away in an epic collaboration with *Star Wars*. This limited-time event transforms the familiar MONOPOLY GO! universe into a sci-fi playground filled with iconic characters, cosmic challenges, and nostalgic charm.

The centerpiece of the event is the ‘Star Wars GO!’ Sticker Album, featuring comic-style stories told through the eyes of PEG-E. Players can collect stickers of beloved characters like Luke Skywalker, Yoda, Darth Vader, Grogu, R2-D2, and many more across themed sets that highlight Jedi, Sith, and other iconic figures.

Classic minigames get a Star Wars makeover—think podracing with Qui-Gon Jinn or rolling through Tatooine—and players can unlock limited-time cosmetics like tokens, shields, and emojis. With themed daily events, puzzles, and community challenges, this crossover continues MONOPOLY GO!’s streak of delivering large-scale, deeply branded experiences that blend nostalgia and gameplay.

### Raid Rush x Terminator 2: Judgment Day

From May 1 to June 30, 2025, *Raid Rush* is joining forces with the legendary sci-fi franchise *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*in an epic, limited-time tower defense crossover. Players take on Skynet’s full-scale invasion in a two-season live-ops event packed with iconic characters, custom campaigns, and legendary rewards.

Sarah Connor, John Connor, and the reprogrammed T-800 become new playable heroes, each equipped with unique combat abilities and immersive narrative arcs. Across 21 campaign episodes, players will battle Terminator enemies like HK-Tanks, HK-Aerials, and the formidable T-1000.

The event also includes themed Battle Pass content, daily login rewards, and exclusive limited-time bundles, all designed to supercharge player engagement and monetization. As Panteon CEO Ufuk Şahin shared, “Bringing the iconic *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* universe to *Raid Rush* has allowed us to combine our strategic tower defense gameplay with the beloved characters and story of a cinematic masterpiece.”

### Triple Match 3D x Dots.eco

For the second year in a row, Ilyon’s *Triple Match 3D* has partnered with environmental impact platform Dots.eco to transform player actions into real-world results. In celebration of Earth Week, this collaboration launched a global community event where every in-game match contributes toward planting actual trees on the planet.

Players collect in-game saplings, and once the community reaches its goal, Dots.eco and Ilyon commit to planting real trees—reinforcing the idea that play can create tangible, positive change. The initiative is not just good for the planet but also boosts engagement and in-game KPIs, as players feel motivated to contribute toward a larger cause together.

If you’re interested in creating similar events for your game, reach out to [Daniel Madrid](/in/danielmadridspitz/) from Dots.eco for more details about their inspiring initiatives.

### Solitaire Grand Harvest x The Smurfs

As of April 1, Solitaire Grand Harvest launched a Smurf-tacular collaboration with *The Smurfs*, bringing the blue crew to the beloved farming-themed solitaire game. In this multi-week event, players are invited to help the Smurfs build their dream village while completing solitaire levels, earning themed rewards, and progressing through a vibrant joint album.

The entire game receives a cheerful makeover, with appearances by Smurfette, Papa Smurf, Gargamel, and Azrael throughout new missions and challenges. Players can collect coins to construct a personalized Smurfs village and participate in rotating features like Yard Finds™, cooking in Sunny’s Kitchen™, and virtual tournaments.

Roi Glazer, GM of Solitaire Grand Harvest, shared: “This partnership offers fans a unique opportunity to engage with the beloved franchise in an interactive and immersive way. With the Smurfs taking over the farm, players can experience a fresh twist on solitaire while enjoying the nostalgia and charm of these iconic characters.”

The collaboration also aligns with the upcoming Smurfs movie, releasing in July 2025, making this in-game event part of a broader entertainment campaign blending IP, gameplay, and community engagement.

### Stumble Guys x SKIBIDI TOILET

In one of the most chaotic and meme-fueled collaborations to date, *Stumble Guys* has teamed up with the viral sensation *Skibidi Toilet* for the **Concrete Chaos** event. This crossover blends Scopely’s beloved multiplayer mayhem with the absurd energy of Skibidi’s web series, bringing new cosmetics, maps, and animations into the game.

Players can unlock six Skibidi-themed styles—ranging from Toilets to Speakermen, Cameramen, and TV Men—alongside new emotes, victory animations, and a limited-time elimination map called **Graffiti Gravity**, where one wrong move sends you falling from a city skyline. Themed cosmetics also let players pick sides in the great “tech vs toilet” war.

As Game Director Jake Bales noted, this collab is a natural fit: “Both started as Gen Z sensations… this collab is all about embracing our inner wild side—because in the Stumbleverse, anything goes.”

### Mobile Legends: Bang Bang x Naruto

Launching on May 2, *Mobile Legends: Bang Bang* brings the legendary ninja world of *Naruto* into the arena with its most ambitious anime collaboration yet. The event introduces five iconic Naruto characters as limited-time skins: Lukas as Naruto Uzumaki, Suyou as Sasuke Uchiha, Kalea as Sakura Haruno, Hayabusa as Kakashi Hatake, and Vale as Gaara.

Alongside the character skins, players can explore a Naruto-themed map, complete themed missions, and earn exclusive cosmetics in the Ninjutsu Academy event. The Vale “Gaara” skin is available for free through event participation, while the rest can be unlocked via a special draw system.

This crossover celebrates Naruto’s lasting cultural impact and enhances MLBB’s appeal to anime fans worldwide—delivering not just cosmetic upgrades, but a full-on Naruto experience with interface overhauls and immersive storytelling.
