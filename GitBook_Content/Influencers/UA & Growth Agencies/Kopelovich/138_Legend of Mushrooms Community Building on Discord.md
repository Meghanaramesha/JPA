###### I’ve been exploring Legend of Mushroom’s 🍄 approach to community building on Discord, and I’m really impressed with the variety of channels they offer to keep players engaged. Here are some standout channels that other games could consider incorporating into their own Discord strategy:

💬 Suggested Groups and Ways to Engage Your Discord Audience:  
  
1. 📢 Announcements & Updates:  
 – Channels like announcements, game-updates, and gift-codes keep players informed about everything from new features to free rewards. Keeping communication clear and frequent builds trust and loyalty.  
  
2. 🎉 Community Engagement:  
 – Channels like community-events and pal-design-contest invite players to participate in fun events, share ideas, and contribute to the game’s development. These are great ways to keep your community active and involved.  
  
3. 🛠️ Support & Feedback:  
 – Dedicated channels for contacting mods, reporting bugs, and offering suggestions allow players to share their concerns and help improve the game. Players feel valued when their voices are heard.  
  
4. 🎨 Creation & Sharing:  
 – Channels like players-guides, video, meme, and art-work let players express their creativity and share tips. Encouraging user-generated content keeps the community lively and connected.  
  
5. 🤝 Chat & Social:  
 – Global chat, ask-the-players, and guild recruitment channels help players build relationships and work together in-game, fostering a sense of belonging.  
  
With over 212,000 members and 14,770 online, it’s clear this strategy is paying off! 🎯 If you’re looking to build or enhance your game’s community, these are some great ideas to start with.  
  
What do you think? How are other games using Discord to engage players?
