Welcome back to Part 6 of *The Power of Partnership* series, where we dive into the latest and most exciting collaborations in the mobile gaming world. This time, I’m thrilled to have my regular partner-in-crime, [Constantin-Alexandru Iorga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAADsjtp0BhB4d3wGDTykDKqzWw63WzISIFDk?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADsjtp0BhB4d3wGDTykDKqzWw63WzISIFDk), Sr. LiveOps Manager at Scopely, joining us once again to bring his expert insights. Alex has been instrumental in helping us break down the latest collaborations, and together we’ll take a closer look at how these partnerships continue to push the boundaries of creativity, engagement, and monetization in mobile games.

This month’s spotlight is on some highly anticipated collaborations, including *Genshin Impact x McDonald’s*, *Summoners War x Jujutsu Kaisen*, *Brawl Stars x SpongeBob SquarePants*, and more! Let’s jump in and explore how these partnerships are reshaping the landscape of mobile gaming.

### Genshin Impact x McDonald’s Collaboration

From September 17 to 29, 2024, *Genshin Impact* is partnering with McDonald’s in the U.S. to offer a limited-time menu featuring exclusive in-game rewards. Players can enjoy themed menu items like the “Genshin Impact Apple Pie” and the “Genshin Impact Deluxe McCrispy™ Meal,” with each purchase unlocking special in-game bonuses.

Purchasing through the McDonald’s app gives players redemption codes for rewards such as Primogems, exclusive *Genshin Impact* items like the “Wings of Delicacies” Wind Glider, a Golden Apple Pastry Recipe, and more.

To participate, simply order via the McDonald’s app, and after completing the purchase, a redemption code will be sent via email. Players can redeem their rewards on the *Genshin Impact* website to unlock these unique items.

This collaboration marks a fun crossover for fans of both the game and McDonald’s, offering a blend of real-world enjoyment and in-game rewards.

### Garena Free Fire x Samsung Collaboration

Garena has announced a multi-season partnership with Samsung Electronics for the *Free Fire* World Series (FFWS) Southeast Asia, covering both the Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 seasons.

This collaboration comes at a critical time for *Free Fire*, as the popular battle royale continues to refine its competitive ecosystem. Garena has positioned the Galaxy S24 Ultra as the official device for the tournament, providing players with cutting-edge gaming technology to enhance their in-game performance. This move supports Garena’s vision of elevating mobile esports and further solidifies *Free Fire* as a staple in the competitive gaming scene.

The FFWS Southeast Asia 2024 Fall will feature 18 teams from Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia, all competing for a share of the $300,000 prize pool and coveted spots in the FFWS Global Finals 2024. The tournament kicks off on August 16 with six weeks of online knockout matches, culminating in the grand finals from October 11-13 in Surabaya, Indonesia. Garena’s strategic focus on building robust regional tournaments like FFWS Southeast Asia showcases its commitment to cultivating a thriving esports community, while the “Fight for Legacy” slogan captures the ambition of teams seeking both regional and global dominance.

Garena’s investment in *Free Fire* esports is more than just a spectacle; it’s a long-term strategy to maintain player engagement and grow the game’s ecosystem. With regular content updates, region-specific tournaments, and a push toward competitive parity across regions, Garena ensures that *Free Fire* remains relevant to its global player base. This partnership with Samsung, providing players with the best competitive conditions, strengthens *Free Fire’s* position in the mobile esports landscape.

From a broader perspective, *Free Fire’s* ability to attract major sponsors like Samsung reflects its continued growth. While other mobile esports titles have faced challenges, Garena has been able to evolve *Free Fire’s* ecosystem, maintaining strong viewership—peaking at over 570,000 during FFWS 2023. With viewership numbers on the rise and more teams entering the competitive space, *Free Fire* continues to be a dominant force in the global esports market. Garena’s multi-layered approach—balancing casual player engagement with top-tier competition—ensures that *Free Fire* will continue to thrive for years to come.

### Summoners War x Jujutsu Kaisen Collaboration

The collaboration is a prime example of how a popular IP can be effectively integrated to drive engagement, monetization, and retention. Let’s break down how this partnership has translated into gameplay and player experiences across the board.

**1. Engagement Through Collaboration Missions**

The new Team Mission Event is the backbone of this collaboration, emphasizing social interaction and engagement. Players must add guild members or friends to complete daily missions. The event is split into three stages, each with specific milestones that encourage players to work together.

• **Stage 1:** Players work in teams to defeat monsters, with rewards given at three key milestones: 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 monsters killed. Rewards range from mana stones and energy to more valuable in-game items.o To maintain engagement between milestones, a Bonus Mission has been added, where defeating 1,500 monsters gives players 50,000 mana stones. This can be completed up to 10 times per day, stacking rewards up to 500,000 mana stones.

• **Stage 2:** This stage focuses on collaboration content missions. Players complete missions with teammates to earn Jujutsu High Emblems, which are awarded after completing four missions. These can be earned multiple times and exchanged for rewards.

• **Stage 3:** The final stage incentivizes players to collect as many emblems as possible. The more emblems players earn, the better the rewards they unlock. To keep players engaged until the very end, this stage remains open for 24 hours after the event concludes.

The collaborative nature of these missions, paired with incremental rewards, creates a structure that encourages not just participation but repeated engagement.

**2. Monetization with Limited-Time Shop Offers**

The Limited-Time Surprise Shop has been a critical element in monetizing this collaboration. Offering various packages from $5 to $100, the shop includes everything from scrolls (used to summon new monsters) to consumables like energy, crystals, and mana stones.• Notably, the higher-end offers contain Jujutsu Kaisen Scrolls, which allow players to summon one of the IP’s iconic monsters. However, not all IAPs directly offer Jujutsu Kaisen characters, with some deals focusing on game resources instead.• These IAP offers cater to different player segments, offering content that appeals to both IP fans and regular spenders. Integrating scrolls with Jujutsu Kaisen characters taps into the IP’s fanbase, while balancing content with consumables ensures value for players across all spending cohorts.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQETeMoBTDOx_Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1726688059650?e=1732147200&v=beta&t=qlvX57TGeoqfgbFjq2YCcFvgqI8T0xoN2Y7Khx50BLE)

The constant rotation of offers and the integration of IP-themed content help sustain excitement and push players towards making purchases.

**3. Community Integration and Social Media Engagement**

To boost both in-game engagement and community involvement, *Summoners War* launched a Trivia Quiz Event focused on the collaboration’s main villain, Sukuna. • Players are encouraged to follow the game’s Instagram account, comment on the event post, and answer six trivia questions about Sukuna’s abilities and stats. This event incentivizes participation by offering real-life prizes (iPads, headphones, power banks) and in-game rewards, such as 100 Energy, 100,000 Mana Stones, and Mystical Scrolls. Even players who answer incorrectly receive rewards, though they are smaller (1 Mystical Scroll compared to 2 for correct answers).

This event helps deepen the connection between the IP and the game, while boosting the game’s presence on social media platforms, creating a full-circle experience that extends beyond the game itself.

**4. Time-Limited Resources to Improve Game KPIs**

The introduction of Cursed Crystals is a standout feature of the Sorcerer’s Weekly Special Mission Event, adding another layer of excitement to the collaboration. • Players earn Cursed Crystals by spending or obtaining regular crystals (e.g., spending 100 regular crystals earns 30 Cursed Crystals). These crystals can also be earned from the Jujutsu Kaisen Event Dungeon, Jujutsu High School Realm, and by defeating the Arena rival Master X. • There are weekly milestones for collecting Cursed Crystals, rewarding players at 50, 250, and 500 crystals. Additionally, players can earn bonus Cursed Crystals through a 10-day calendar event by logging in daily and completing missions that require them to spend 100 Energy.

The event’s design cleverly ties into the game’s main battle loop, ensuring players are continually incentivized to engage with the core gameplay mechanics. By linking rewards to in-game activity, the event encourages players to stay active and engaged, while the time-limited nature of the crystals creates a sense of urgency.
