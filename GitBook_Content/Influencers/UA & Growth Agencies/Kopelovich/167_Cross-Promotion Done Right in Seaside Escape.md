##### I just stumbled upon a brilliant example of cross-promotion in a game called Seaside Escape by Microfun.

###### This merge game integrates the promotion of another game from their studio portfolio in a way that feels natural and seamlessly part of the live-ops experience. 👏

**What Makes This Cross-Promo Special? 🤔**

Microfun has created a special “event” within Seaside Escape, complete with an icon and timer just like any other in-game event.

When players tap on the icon, a pop-up screen appears advertising their new game, Merge County, along with an offer wall featuring different missions.

Completing these missions in the new game rewards players in Seaside Escape, making the promotion feel like an integrated part of the gameplay.

###### This method of cross-promotion not only introduces players to a new game but also enhances their engagement by providing tangible rewards for their efforts.

###### Why It Works 💡

* Natural Integration: The event format makes the promotion feel like a part of the game, rather than an intrusive ad.
* Player Incentives: Offering in-game rewards for trying out a new game adds value and motivation for players.
* Increased Engagement: Players are more likely to engage with a new game when there are immediate benefits in their current game.

This is one of the best examples of cross-promotion that feels natural and effectively part of the live-ops strategy.
