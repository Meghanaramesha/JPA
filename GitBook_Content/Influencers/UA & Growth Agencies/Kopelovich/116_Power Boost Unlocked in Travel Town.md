###### 🚀 Power Boost Unlocked in Travel Town! 🚀

Recently, I unlocked a unique feature at level 22 called Power Boost. Here’s how it works: You can spend 2x energy per use instead of 1, and it promises to generate higher-level items. However, while this seems like a shortcut, I’m not fully convinced that it significantly saves energy. It feels more like a way to accelerate your gameplay rather than increase efficiency.  
  
🔍 Observations:  
– It’s interesting to see elements from social casino games, like those in Coin Master, adapted to the merge game genre. Moon Active (or whoever introduced this first) has definitely shaken things up.  
– Unlocking this feature at a relatively high level (around day 14 of casual play) adds a layer of strategy and temptation.  
  
💭 Psychological Impact:  
– The “spend faster, buy more” approach is pretty clear. The feature encourages players to burn through resources quickly, leading to potential purchases to maintain progress.  
  
🤔 Community Question: What do you think? Is this feature a good or bad fit for merge games and player experience?  
  
✅ Pros: Faster progress, excitement of unlocking high-level items, keeps players engaged.  
❌ Cons: Potentially increases spending pressure, might not save energy, could feel like a cash grab.
