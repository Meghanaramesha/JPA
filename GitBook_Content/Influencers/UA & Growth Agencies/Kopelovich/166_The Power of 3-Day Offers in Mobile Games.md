##### I have been noticing a growing trend in mobile games lately: The 3-day Offer

This type of promotion has been popping up in various games and it’s easy to see why—it works wonders for both player retention and revenue. 💰

###### What Are 3-Day Offers? 🤔

3-day offers are special promotions that provide players with valuable rewards over a period of three days, typically at a low price. These offers usually appear early in the game, such as a welcome offer, and encourage players to return daily to collect their rewards.

##### **Why They Work 💡**

**– Retention Boost:** By requiring players to log in over multiple days, these offers effectively increase player retention. Players are more likely to come back to the game if they’ve already invested in future play.  
  
**– Great Value:** These offers provide substantial value at a low cost, making them attractive to players who might otherwise be hesitant to spend money.  
  
**– Early Investment:** Offering something valuable at the start ensures that players feel committed to the game. Once they’ve made an initial purchase, they’re more likely to continue spending.

###### 3-day offers are a win-win for both players and developers.

They provide great value and incentives for players while boosting retention and revenue for developers.

If you haven’t implemented this strategy in your game yet, it might be time to give it a try!
