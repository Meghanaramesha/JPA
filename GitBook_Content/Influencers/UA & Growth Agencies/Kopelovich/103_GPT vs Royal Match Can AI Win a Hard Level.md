**Introduction**

Ever wondered if GPT could help beat a tricky level in Royal Match? Well, I decided to put it to the test. Before diving into the game, I made sure to “train” GPT on the basics of Royal Match, explaining the mechanics, how to create power-ups, and ensuring it understood the fundamentals as best as I could. With that prep done, I tackled a hard level with GPT as my guide, move by move. Here’s how it went:

---

**The Setup**

The level was challenging, with limited moves and multiple objectives: clear the wooden crates, collect yellow crowns, and free the piggies. Armed with screenshots for every move, I consulted GPT for its recommendations, following them step by step. Did GPT’s logic bring me victory? Let’s find out.

---

### The Moves

**Move 1:** Match three red tiles in the bottom right corner to start clearing the board.

**Move 2:** Match the three green tiles at the bottom right corner.

**Move 3:** Match the three blue shields in the bottom row of the upper section (aligned horizontally, just above the wooden boxes).

**Move 4:** Match the three red tiles in the middle row near the yellow crown.

**Move 5:** Match the three blue shields near the center of the top board.

**Move 6:** use the rocket on the same tile it currently occupies (do not move it left or right).

**Move 7:** Match the three yellow crowns at the bottom of the upper section

**Move 8:** Match the three red tiles in the middle of the upper section.

**Move 9:** Match the three green leaves in the top section (middle row).

**Move 10:** Match the three green leaves in the upper part .

**Move 11:** Activate the TNT directly by tapping it where it stands.

**Move 12:** Activate the propeller power-up by tapping it where it stands.

**Move 13:** Match the three yellow crowns in the middle of the board.

**Move 14:** Match the blue shields and red tiles in the middle of the board to create a Rocket.

**Move 16:** Activate the propeller power-up.

**Move 17:** Match the 4 green tiles to create the rocket.

**Move 19:** Match the three green leaves near the center of the board (middle row).

**Move 20:** Move the TNT to the right and then activate it.

**Move 21:** match the green leaves in the lower section (down).

**Move 22:** Activate the vertical Rocket on the far right (near the purple pigs).

**Move 23:** Activate the vertical rocket near the center of the board.

**Move 24:** Activate the Rocket in the center of the board (horizontal orientation).

**Move 25:** With one move left, GPT suggested matching three red tiles, but it wasn’t enough. The game ended with most objectives still incomplete.

**Reflections**

Honestly, I’m a bit disappointed. While GPT demonstrated some logical thinking and followed the basics well, its overall strategy felt shallow. It often focused on immediate moves without considering the long-term impact, and I frequently had to step in and remind it of missed opportunities to create power-ups, which were critical for this level.

I’ll take some of the blame here—I probably didn’t “train” GPT well enough to focus on building a sustainable, strategic approach rather than just reacting to the current board. That said, it also highlights the limitations of AI in understanding the nuances of game design and the importance of player intuition.

This experiment reinforced one thing: while GPT can be a helpful assistant, it’s no replacement for human creativity and strategy—at least not yet. Maybe with further “training” on long-term goals and prioritizing power-ups, GPT could become a better gaming ally.
