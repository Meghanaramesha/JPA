Fortress Merge – Speed Up Offers ⚡

I spotted an interesting monetization approach in Fortress Merge by TapNation: selling time-based speed-ups that double combat speed (24h, 72h, or infinite).  
  
In a wave-based enemies game, this is a huge advantage — it shortens grind time, keeps sessions more dynamic, and makes progression feel smoother.  
  
What’s smart here:  
🎯 Players who want faster waves get a strong incentive to pay.  
🎯 The tiered options (daily, 3 days, or infinite) give flexibility — great for testing spending intent.  
🎯 It’s essentially a time-saver offer, but framed as an exciting power-up.  
  
Curious — would you treat this more as a core monetization feature or keep it as a side convenience perk for players who value speed?
