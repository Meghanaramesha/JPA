###### 🚫🎮 Ad-Free Options in Tetris® Block Puzzle: What’s the Strategy?

I recently came across this interesting ad-free offer in “Tetris® Block Puzzle” by PLAYSTUDIOS. It got me thinking about the possible strategies behind offering ad-free gameplay for 7, 14, or 30 days instead of a permanent option. 🤔   
  
Why might a game choose this kind of setup? Here are some hypotheses:  
  
1️⃣ Recurring Revenue: By offering a subscription-like model, they aim to generate steady income from players who renew regularly.  
  
2️⃣ Retention Alignment: Since the average player retention is around 20 days, the 30-day package ensures players stay ad-free throughout their active period.  
  
3️⃣ Psychological Appeal: The tiered options lower the commitment barrier. Players might test with a 7-day pass, then feel compelled to upgrade for longer.  
  
4️⃣ Player Segmentation: Different spending habits, different options! Some might prefer smaller, repeatable spends, while others go for the 30-day deal.  
  
5️⃣ Flexibility in Monetization: This setup appeals to casual and hardcore players, capturing value from a broad audience.
