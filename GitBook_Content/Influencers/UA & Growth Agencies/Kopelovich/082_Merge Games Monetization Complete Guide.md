Hello and welcome back, everyone!

Thank you for joining me for another genre exploration in our journey through the diverse world of mobile gaming monetization. If you missed our last discussion on the most utilized monetization strategies in social-casino games, be sure to check it out [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/complete-guide-social-casino-game-monetization-michael-kopelovich-tj8cf/). It’s full of insights that might inspire your next big idea, regardless of the genre you’re currently working on.

Today, we’re delving into the captivating world of merge games. While different from social-casino games, the principles of monetization remain universal and highly adaptable. So, let’s uncover how this genre keeps players engaged and, more importantly, how it turns that engagement into revenue.

### Market Trends and Evolution in Merge Games

As we delve into the merge games genre, we notice a significant evolution from its origins. Initially characterized by their straightforward drag-and-combine mechanics, merge games have grown into complex, engaging worlds that keep players entertained for hours. This transformation has introduced more sophisticated elements like strategy, storytelling, and resource management, broadening the genre’s appeal and enriching player experiences.

This evolution has paved the way for inventive monetization strategies. Merge games like “Merge Dragons” and “EverMerge” demonstrate how the integration of various game mechanics can not only retain player engagement but also effectively open their wallets. These games combine direct in-app purchases, ad integrations, and subscription models to create a balanced and enticing monetization framework.

The key takeaway here is the balance between keeping players engaged and encouraging them to spend. This balance is crucial and can serve as a blueprint for monetization across different genres. By understanding how merge games successfully implement these strategies, we can gather insights and inspiration for our own projects.

### Diving Deeper: Real-World Examples

Moving from theory to practice, let’s examine specific examples from leading merge games. These cases shed light on practical applications of the strategies we’ve discussed and show how they contribute to the games’ success. As we review each example, consider how these approaches could be adapted to fit the unique aspects of your projects, aiming not for imitation but for inspiration.

\*Please note: In this exploration, we’re focusing exclusively on In-App Purchase (IAP) monetization strategies. While there’s also a significant presence of rewarded video placements throughout many games, we’ll set those aside for now. The nuances and impacts of rewarded videos deserve their own detailed discussion, which I plan to cover in a future article dedicated to that topic.

**“Starter Bundle”**

Evermerge welcomes newcomers with a “Starter Bundle,” offering a quick advancement boost at a discount. This approach targets players who prefer immediate action over slow progress, introducing them to the game’s economy smoothly. Key to its success is A/B testing various resource combinations to find the most appealing offer. It’s a smart strategy for converting first-time players into paying customers, demonstrating the value of tailored starter packs across different game genres.

**“Endless Offer”**

Endless Offers have recently emerged as a pivotal element in mobile game monetization, captivating players with a never-ending array of deals to keep their engagement levels high. This strategy, now prevalent across various game genres, thrives by offering players a mix of complimentary rewards and purchasable items, ensuring there’s always something new on the horizon.

Interested in exploring this topic further? I’ve written a comprehensive article dedicated entirely to Endless Offers, including diverse strategies for A/B testing and real-world examples [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mastering-monetization-mobile-games-endless-offers-michael-kopelovich-gop8f/).

‘Merge Gardens’ – Endless Offer

**“Extra Garden Tiles”**

A common challenge in merge games, like the one presented in “Mergical,” is the initial scarcity of space, especially as players accumulate items such as eggs and other valuable items that they wish to merge rather than sell. To address this, many games offer “Extra Garden Tiles” – a small island expansion that not only provides additional room for organization but also comes packed with bonuses. This strategy appeals particularly to those who crave order and space in their game world, offering a clever solution to expand their playground and enhance their experience.

**“Decoy Offers”**

Continuing with the extra garden tile example, “Merge Tales” offers an interesting use of tiered space expansion deals to engage players. The game presents three distinct options: 10 extra tiles for $2.9, 20 extra tiles for $14.9, and a strategically positioned 30 extra tiles for $24.9. This setup, particularly the pricing strategy, acts as a clever decoy offer. It subtly nudges players towards the highest-value option by making it appear more cost-effective compared to the middle choice.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGnO_vh0rN97A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1708675026048?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=ehzN2MfMIPSIOf5UfC5aoB_FfOBpo_j55UCN9iN3jek)

‘Merge Tales’ – Decoy

Continuing our dive into smart monetization, ‘Merge Dragons’ showcases a classic yet impactful approach with its Chinese New Year Pack. Players are presented with a choice of three enticing packages: a Special pack for $9.99, an Exclusive one for $19.99, and the lavish Deluxe at $49.99. But here’s the clever part: a “Buy All” option is introduced at $69.99, making it look like the deal of the century. This bundle not only leverages the decoy effect but updates it for today’s savvy gamers, who love feeling like they’re getting the most bang for their buck. The rise of such “Buy All” options across different game genres marks a significant shift in offer packaging. It’s a vital strategy for developers aiming to boost the perceived value of their deals, encouraging players to opt for more comprehensive bundles.

**“Daily Gems Offer”**

‘Merge Gardens’ introduces a compelling Daily Gems Offer, where players can purchase a 30-day gem pack, receiving 25 gems each day for a total of 750 gems. What sets this offer apart is its dual function: beyond generating revenue, it’s a clever retention strategy. Players are incentivized to log in daily to collect their gems, as the offer doesn’t allow accumulation and misses result in lost gems. This requirement ensures consistent player engagement, as logging in for gems often leads to further gameplay. It’s a smart way to keep players coming back, blending monetization with daily activity encouragement.

**“Energy Packs”**

In ‘Evermerge,’ running out of energy doesn’t mean game over; it’s a chance for both players to keep the fun going and for developers to monetize. The “Energy Pack” is perfectly timed, offering players a much-needed energy boost to continue their adventures. This strategy is not just about selling—it’s about understanding player needs at a pivotal moment. To ensure these offers hit the mark, experimenting with various pricing and bundles is key. It’s a delicate balance to strike, but with the right mix, players are more likely to invest, turning a potential stopping point into an opportunity for extended play and additional revenue for the developers.

‘Evermerge’ – Energy Packs

**“Event Pass & Tiered Pass System”**

‘Merge Gardens’ introduces an Event Pass that cleverly incentivizes gameplay through mission completion. This pass features a dual-reward system: free rewards for all players and exclusive, premium rewards for those who purchase the event ticket. By structuring the rewards this way, ‘Merge Gardens’ not only encourages players to engage more deeply with the event but also offers a clear value proposition for the purchase of the event ticket.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGNTneK6TAxNg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1708930344474?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=Zd0NnnzhzwxrJfweHTfnhjlJuNHMse4ko4lf5voT51M)

Merge Gardens – Event Pass

‘Merge Magic’ elevates the event pass strategy by introducing a tiered system, offering players the “Gold Pass” alongside a more premium “Gold Pass Bundle.” This approach not only provides a variety of rewards, including exclusive creatures, eggs, and various boosts, but also caters to different levels of player commitment and preference. With prices set at $12.99 for the standard pass and $19.99 for the bundle, which includes all Gold Pass content plus extra rewards, ‘Merge Magic’ demonstrates a flexible monetization model.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFQ49kTO5tKxA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1708886162742?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=63XH9P7ASl-60pFpkezMTU6oTUUrdesGziYbbI3a9uo)

‘Merge Magic’ – Tier Pass

This tiered pass system, seen across various game genres, is becoming more sophisticated, with some developers even experimenting with multiple battle passes within a single game to appeal to diverse player interests. While this can mean additional design work, it offers a tailored experience that can significantly enhance player engagement and satisfaction.

---

**“Coupon Offers”**

‘Merge Gardens’ utilizes Coupon Offers to directly engage players by presenting them with significant in-game value boosts or discounts redeemable in the game’s store. These offers are not only visually striking but also cleverly designed with clear calls-to-action, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity. An example is the “Exquisite Coupon” that activates a +50% more gems offer, compelling players with a countdown timer to act quickly. This strategy effectively taps into players’ love for rewards and savings, encouraging them to seize the limited-time opportunity.

By varying the offer from a 50% to an even 600% increase, developers have a powerful tool in their arsenal for increasing player investment and driving revenue, highlighting the importance of finding the perfect balance to maximize appeal.

**“Piggy Bank”**

Piggy Banks are a familiar monetization feature in gaming, yet there’s room to level them up. The basic idea? Have multiple banks for different items – energy, coins, or unique game items. This can get players more involved as they have specific goals to meet in each bank. Plus, offering extra incentives when they ‘break’ the bank, like a bonus or another reward, can make the deal more tempting and boost engagement.

**“Chest Offers”**

In “Merge Magic,” the Chest Offers are like opening a treasure trove of surprises. For a small price, these chests promise a mix of eggs, currency, and other goodies that are key to progressing in the game. What makes these offers irresistible isn’t just the value they pack but the excitement of uncovering what’s inside. It’s a bit like the game’s way of saying, “Who knows what you’ll find next?” this kind of offer isn’t unique to ‘Merge Magic’—you’ll find it across most merge games, but by pricing these chests affordably, “Merge Magic” makes it enticing for players to invest in these treasures, blending the excitement of unlocking new possibilities with strategic game advancement.

**“Custom Offers”**

In ‘Merge Tales,’ players are presented with a tiered custom pack, blending the decoy method with a personalized offer system. Players have the autonomy to choose their own rewards, tailoring their purchases to fit their strategic needs at the moment. This level of customization empowers players and enhances the perceived value of each transaction, making the idea of a paid interaction more enticing. By allowing players to align their purchases with immediate gameplay strategies, you can hopefully boost engagement and investment. For those intrigued by the concept of custom offers and how they can elevate game monetization, I’ve delved deeper into this topic in a separate article available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personalized-play-exploring-custom-offers-mobile-michael-kopelovich-n7ebf/?trackingId=ZHQ5Q%2BJ0QtCLYVSMJzrkIQ%3D%3D).

### Conclusion

And there we have it, a journey through the colorful landscape of In-App Purchase (IAP) strategies in the magical world of merge games. We’ve seen how these games cleverly intertwine player engagement with savvy monetization moves, from welcoming starter packs to the excitement of event passes and beyond. Each strategy not only enriches the player’s journey but also carves out paths for developers to sustain and grow their games financially.

What’s the big picture here? It’s all about tuning into your players’ desires and being bold in your monetization experiments. While today we zeroed in on IAPs, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. There’s a whole universe of monetization strategies out there, like rewarded videos, each with its own story to tell and potential to explore in future deep dives.

As merge games continue to evolve, so too will the ingenious ways we find to support them. Keeping an eye on these trends and being ready to adapt will be key. Consider this not just a conclusion but an invitation—to be inspired, to innovate, and to keep making games that players love and support.
