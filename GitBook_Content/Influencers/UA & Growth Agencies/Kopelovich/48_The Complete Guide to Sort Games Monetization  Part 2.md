Hey everyone – welcome back!

[In Part 1 Guide](https://www.gamigion.com/sort-games-monetization-complete-guide/), we explored how sort games use IAPs to generate revenue through starter packs, no-ads offers, and cleverly timed deals. Now it’s time to shift our focus to the **other half of the monetization equation**—Rewarded Video (RV) ads.

Sort games, with their high daily sessions and low cognitive load, are ideal for integrating RV placements. Done right, these ads don’t interrupt the flow—they **enhance it**, offering players value in exchange for short, skippable video views.

Let’s break down some of the most effective placements we’re seeing in top sort games today. Here are some of the most effective and creative rewarded video strategies we’ve seen in recent sort games.

### “Extra Board Space”

Some games let players unlock **extra board space** or **playable slots** via RVs. This is especially smart in sort games where **space management is key,** and players will gladly pay (with ads) to gain a strategic edge.

---

### “Daily Video Bar”

Games like **Thread Jam** and **Blossom Sort** introduce RV “watch bars”—watch 3 to 5 ads and unlock increasing tiered rewards. These placements turn passive ad views into a **mini-progression system**, with tangible value for continued engagement.

---

### “Double Reward – Level Won”

Post-level reward multipliers—like the “x2” button seen in **Bloom Sort** and **Magic Sort**—capitalize on players’ **moment of victory**. The level is already won, so doubling the reward feels like a cherry on top.

---

### “Skins and Cosmetics”

Cosmetic unlocks—like new bunnies in **Bottle Jam** or themed cakes in **Cake Sort**—are often gated behind RVs. These optional personalizations are low-cost to implement and offer **non-intrusive monetization** that doesn’t affect game balance.

---

### “Spin-The-Wheel Rewards”

A classic RV placement—watch an ad to spin the wheel. Games like **Cake Sort** and **Tangle Rope** use bright, satisfying animations and offer multipliers, currency, or boosters. These placements often appear once per session or after level completion, giving players a **mini dopamine hit** that makes the next spin feel worth waiting (or watching) for.

---

### “Free Coins in the Shop”

The shop isn’t just for purchases—it’s also a powerful space for RVs. Games like **Blossom Sort** and **Coffee Pack** place a “Free Coins” button prominently in the store, subtly training players to associate the shop with both spending and earning.

---

### “Daily Rewards ×2”

Doubling daily login rewards through RVs is an easy win. Players already expect a reward—offering them **twice the value** with a single ad watch makes the decision feel like a no-brainer. Seen in **Bottle Jam**, **Crazy Car Jam**, and many others.

---

### “Revive Mechanics”

When players run out of moves or space, revive ads step in. **Blossom Sort** and **Wool Sort** offer players a second chance in exchange for ad views or soft currency. This taps into **loss aversion**—players don’t want to give up their progress and are happy to trade 30 seconds of attention to keep going.

### Final Thoughts

Rewarded videos are a cornerstone of sort game monetization—not just because they’re effective, but because they feel **fair and optional**. Players get value, developers get revenue, and everyone walks away happy.

Together, IAP and RV strategies create a balanced, sustainable monetization system that supports long-term player engagement.

Got a favorite RV placement I missed?

Let me know—I’d love to keep building this guide with real-world examples from across the industry.

Until next time! – Michael
