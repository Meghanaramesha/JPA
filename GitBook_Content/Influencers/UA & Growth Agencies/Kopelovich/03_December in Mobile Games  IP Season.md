This month always brings some of the strongest IP activations in the industry, and 2024 is no different.

Here are three collaborations currently live and the strategic angle behind each one.

#### 📌 MONOPOLY GO! ✕ Harry Potter

This collab leans heavily into nostalgia and global brand power. Harry Potter brings a multi-generation fanbase, strong emotional pull, and massive social reach. Perfect timing too — Warner Bros is pushing new franchise activity with the upcoming Harry Potter Max streaming series, so awareness is high. For Scopely, it strengthens re-engagement and drives premium offer conversions tied to themed event.

#### 📌 June’s Journey ✕ Wicked

A great example of syncing a game with a major entertainment release. The Wicked movie promotion is everywhere right now, and Wooga is using it to refresh the fantasy/mystery theme of June’s Journey. This type of collab boosts cultural relevance and brings in a more mainstream audience who connects with the film’s characters and aesthetic. Strong fit for narrative-driven LiveOps.

#### 📌 Legend of Mushroom ✕ One Punch Man

This one is pure fan energy. With the new OPM anime season in promotion, the timing is ideal. Legend of Mushroom benefits from a younger, high-engagement audience that loves power fantasy IPs. These collabs typically spike retention for mid-core casual games and open new monetization paths via limited characters and themed bundles.  
  
*December is always wild for IP.*

Studios sync with movie launches, anime seasons, holiday spending, and big nostalgia cycles. It’s the best time to watch how IP affects UA, Retention & LiveOps performance.
