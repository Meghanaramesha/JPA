Really like this 3-stage progression setup for a competitive event.

Each stage ramps up the challenge — and the coin rewards scale with it (50 → 100 → 200).

**It’s a simple structure, but it works:**  
✅ Clear goals  
✅ Increasing payoff  
✅ A sense of momentum as you climb  
  
A good reminder that you don’t always need complex mechanics to make an event feel engaging just steady progression and rewards that match the effort.
