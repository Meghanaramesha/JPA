Welcome back to *The Power of Partnership*, where we track the wildest, smartest, and most unexpected collaborations that keep the gaming universe spinning. In Part #10, we’re taking it beyond mobile. That’s right—this roundup spans mobile, console, and PC collabs that are not just slapping IP skins on characters, but reinventing gameplay, building communities, and blending genres in ways that didn’t feel possible even a few years ago.

Let’s dive into the latest wave of partnerships pushing the boundaries of creativity and connectivity in gaming.

#### Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds × Minecraft, SpongeBob, TMNT, Avatar

Featuring guest racers like Steve (Minecraft), SpongeBob, TMNT, and Aang (Avatar), this multiverse kart racer intertwines track themes like BiKiNi BOTTOM and Lion Turtle Islands with signature style. These DLCs deliver new vehicles, tracks, and bending mechanics for avatars racing at warp speed.

#### Fortnite Festival × Rock Band & Music Icons

Epic Games is rewriting the music-rhythm playbook with *Fortnite Festival*. Think Rock Band meets Fortnite—with controller-free rhythm gameplay, artist-branded cosmetics, and live events featuring stars like Bruno Mars and Sabrina Carpenter. It’s a seamless fusion of music fandom and gaming culture.

#### Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition on Nintendo Switch 2

Cyberpunk is back—but this time, *optimized* for Switch 2. Beyond packing content, CD Projekt Red harnessed the console’s hardware to reshape the gameplay experience. Joy-Con as mouse, motion swings for swords, gyroscope precision aiming—these are the touches that turn a franchise launch into a **system-defining showcase**

#### RAID: Shadow Legends × Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Cowabunga! The heroes in a half shell have dropped into *RAID: Shadow Legends* for a time-limited crossover with Paramount. Players can recruit Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo, April O’Neil, and even Shredder as Legendary Champions.

Log in to grab Michelangelo for free, tackle Shredder in a special event dungeon, and unlock the rest of the crew through events and fusions. Packed with a cinematic launch spot and community events, this collab brings pure Turtle Power to RAID’s fantasy battlefield.

#### Stumble Guys x Jurassic World

Stumble Guys just dropped its biggest collaboration yet — and it’s a roar! Teaming up with *Jurassic World* (right as the film hits theaters), the update brings a new prehistoric-themed map, *Jurassic Rush*, packed with lava jumps, stampeding dinos, and chaos at every turn.

The timing couldn’t be better. By syncing with the movie’s release, Stumble Guys taps into the excitement of a global franchise while keeping its content fresh and fun. It’s another great example of how smart collaborations can boost both engagement and cultural relevance.
