Just came across a fascinating feature in Coin Master that I haven’t seen before—a scrolling endless offer sequence. Instead of the usual set of 6 offers, players are invited to scroll through a sequence of 12 offers to see all the rewards. This adds a new layer of engagement and curiosity to the purchasing experience.  
  
**What caught my attention even more was the pricing strategy employed. The sequence is structured as follows:**  
– Paid: 49.9 (800 spins)  
– Free  
– Free  
– Free  
– Free  
– Free  
– Paid: 39.9 (800 spins)  
– Free  
– Free  
– Paid: 17.9 (800 spins)  
– Free  
– Free  
  
Starting with the most expensive paid offer, the same reward is then offered at a reduced price further down the sequence. It taps into the psychological principle of “commitment and consistency.” If a player buys the first offer, they may feel more inclined to buy the subsequent ones at a lower price, thinking, “I’ve already invested at a higher price; why not get more for less?”

Check out the video to see how this scrolling feature works and how the offers are strategically placed! 🎥👇
