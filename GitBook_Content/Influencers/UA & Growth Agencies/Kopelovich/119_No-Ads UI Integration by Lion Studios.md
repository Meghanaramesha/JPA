###### 🎨 “Sticker Book” by Lion Studios just nailed it with this clever UI integration!

They’ve placed the “Ad-Free” option prominently at the top of the screen, keeping it constantly in view.

The clear “OFF” status indicator is a brilliant move, subtly encouraging players to consider turning it “ON.” Even better, tapping on it triggers a no-ads offer to be presented instantly—making it super easy for players to act! 💡  
  
It’s all about visibility, accessibility, and smart positioning.

What do you think of this approach? Would this catch your attention if you were playing?
