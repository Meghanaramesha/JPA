###### Spotted a cool feature in Dream Blast by Rovio, They use a pop-up carousel to promote their other games like Angry Birds 2 and Sugar Blast. Cross-promotion like this is a smart way to keep players engaged. Here’s how it can work:

1️⃣ Keeping players around: If someone’s about to stop playing, show them another game they might love.   
  
2️⃣ Turning non-spenders into spenders: Maybe a player isn’t spending in this game, but they might in another one.   
  
3️⃣ Matching interests: Suggesting games with similar vibes keeps things fun and familiar.   
  
4️⃣ Highlighting special events: Promote exciting events happening in other games to catch their interest.   
  
A simple but clever way to keep players in the family. Nice work, Rovio! 👏
