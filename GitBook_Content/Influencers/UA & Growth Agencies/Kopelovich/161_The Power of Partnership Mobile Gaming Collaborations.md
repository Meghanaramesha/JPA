#### Fortnite & Rocket League x Tesla Cybertruck

In an exciting collaboration that took place this summer, Tesla’s controversial Cybertruck made its debut in *Fortnite* and *Rocket League* starting on July 23. Epic Games, the publisher of both games, announced that players could virtually drive the iconic Cybertruck across both titles.

In *Fortnite*, the collaboration featured the Cybertruck Bundle, which included the Tesla Cybertruck body, four unique decals, and Cyber Wheels. Players could earn these items by completing the nine-part Summer Road Trip Quest, which ran until July 31, or by purchasing them in the Fortnite Shop starting August 6. Completing all nine quests also unlocked the exclusive Baja Off-Road Decal.

Meanwhile, *Rocket League* players had the chance to earn similar items, including five decals, custom engine audio, and a Starlink + Traction Board Topper. The rewards earned in one game were also available in the other, thanks to cross-game ownership.

This collaboration not only brought Tesla’s futuristic vehicle to two of the biggest titles in gaming but also created an engaging cross-game experience that encouraged players to participate in both games for maximum rewards.

###### And now, I’m handing over the floor to Alex, who will take you through an in-depth exploration of a groundbreaking collaboration between Vodafone and Riot Games.

Alex, with his extensive experience in managing live-ops and his deep understanding of player engagement, will offer you a comprehensive analysis of this partnership and its implications for the gaming industry.

#### Vodafone x Riot Games: Valorant and League of Legends Collaboration

*In a world where the digital landscape is continually expanding, cross-industry collaborations are becoming increasingly essential. Vodafone Romania’s recent partnership with two of the world’s most popular video games, Valorant and League of Legends, exemplifies the potential of such alliances. This collaboration, which has resulted in the launch of the “GoodGaming Sim Card,” is a groundbreaking initiative that marries the strengths of telecommunications with the dynamic world of gaming. Let’s explore how this collaboration works, why it’s beneficial for all parties involved, and its broader implications for the gaming community in Romania.*

**How the Collaboration Works**

At the core of this partnership is the GoodGaming Sim Card, a product designed specifically for gamers. Vodafone Romania has rolled out two distinct versions of this sim card—one for Valorant players and one for League of Legends enthusiasts. Both cards come with benefits that cater directly to the gaming community, such as unlimited mobile internet, unlimited domestic calls, and text messages. But what sets these sim cards apart is the inclusion of in-game rewards: 475 Valorant Points for Valorant players and two Masterwork Chests with Hextech Keys for League of Legends players. These rewards can be redeemed using a code sent via SMS upon activation of the sim card. (the code itself is $$ that can be redeemed in the games for purchasing the mentioned currency/resources)

The promotion is valid until August 31, 2024, with the possibility of extension, and the sim cards are available to individuals aged 16 and above. Initially priced at 6 euros per month for the first three months, the cost increases to 8 euros per month thereafter, with benefits valid for 30 days. This offering is a first for the Romanian telecom market, positioning Vodafone as a pioneer in tailoring products specifically for the gaming community.

##### **Why Cross-Industry Collaborations Matter**

The partnership between Vodafone and two leading video game titles demonstrates the power of cross-industry collaboration. Such collaborations allow companies to tap into new markets and customer segments, enhancing their brand visibility and customer engagement in unique ways. For Vodafone, a telecommunications giant, aligning with popular video games enables the company to connect with a younger, tech-savvy audience that prioritizes connectivity and gaming performance.

From a broader perspective, these partnerships can lead to innovative products that cater to the evolving needs of consumers. As industries converge, we see the emergence of offerings that transcend traditional boundaries, creating value in ways that were previously unimaginable.

**Supporting the Local Gaming Community**

Vodafone’s collaboration with Valorant and League of Legends is not just a commercial endeavor; it is also a commitment to supporting the gaming community in Romania. With over 7.8 million Romanians playing video games at least once a month, the country boasts a vibrant and engaged gaming population. Vodafone’s initiatives, such as supporting local gaming events like Bucharest Gaming Week and E-sports Summit, and partnering with Nexus Team, the top-performing esports team in Romania, underscore the company’s dedication to nurturing this community.

The GoodGaming Sim Card is a tangible expression of this support. By offering a product designed specifically for gamers, Vodafone is addressing the unique needs of this community—namely, the need for reliable, high-speed internet with low latency, which is crucial for an optimal gaming experience. Furthermore, the inclusion of in-game rewards adds an extra layer of value, making the SIM card more appealing to gamers.

**Benefits for Vodafone**

For Vodafone, this collaboration presents several key benefits. First, it strengthens the company’s brand image as a tech-savvy, youth-oriented brand that understands and supports the gaming community. This is particularly important in a market where competition among telecom providers is fierce. By offering a product tailored to gamers, Vodafone can differentiate itself from its competitors and attract a loyal customer base.

Second, the GoodGaming Sim Card provides Vodafone with a new revenue stream. By bundling telecom services with gaming benefits, the company can encourage more frequent recharges and potentially increase the average revenue per user (ARPU). Additionally, the partnership with high-profile games like Valorant and League of Legends can boost Vodafone’s brand visibility both locally and globally.

##### **Benefits for Valorant and League of Legends**

For the games themselves, this partnership offers a unique opportunity to deepen engagement with their player base. By integrating in-game rewards with a real-world product like a sim card, Riot Games (the developer of Valorant and League of Legends) can create a more immersive and rewarding experience for players. This not only encourages continued play but also fosters brand loyalty, as players associate their gaming experience with tangible benefits in the real world.Moreover, the collaboration with Vodafone helps Valorant and League of Legends tap into the Romanian market more effectively. With Vodafone’s extensive reach and marketing capabilities, the games can gain greater exposure and potentially attract new players who are drawn to the unique benefits offered by the GoodGaming Sim Card.

**Implications for the Future**

The Vodafone-Valorant-League of Legends collaboration is a compelling case study in the potential of cross-industry partnerships. It showcases how companies can innovate by combining their strengths and addressing the specific needs of their target audiences. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, we can expect to see more collaborations like this, where the lines between industries blur, leading to the creation of products and services that are greater than the sum of their parts.For the gaming community, this partnership is a positive development. It not only brings tangible benefits to players but also highlights the growing importance of gaming in the broader cultural and economic landscape. As companies like Vodafone continue to invest in the gaming industry, we can anticipate more initiatives that enhance the gaming experience and support the community.In conclusion, Vodafone’s partnership with Valorant and League of Legends is a win-win-win: a win for Vodafone as it strengthens its brand and taps into new revenue streams, a win for Riot Games as it deepens player engagement, and a win for the Romanian gaming community as it receives products and support tailored to its needs. This collaboration sets a precedent for future partnerships and underscores the transformative potential of cross-industry innovation.

**Additional thoughts on the approach**

By bundling in-game rewards with a telecom product, Vodafone has created a differentiated offering that speaks directly to the interests of a specific demographic—gamers. This strategic alignment between product features (unlimited data, low latency) and customer needs (seamless gaming experience) demonstrates a deep understanding of the target market. It also opens up possibilities for future product enhancements, such as tiered gaming rewards based on usage or integrating additional game titles to attract a broader audience. The ability to personalize and gamify the telecom experience through partnerships like this could become a significant differentiator in a highly competitive industry.

This approach is compelling because it directly ties customer spending to both immediate and long-term revenue streams. The sim card’s pricing structure—with an initial low entry cost followed by a slight increase after three months—leverages a classic introductory offer strategy designed to hook users and drive sustained engagement. The inclusion of in-game currency and rewards not only adds perceived value but also encourages users to remain subscribed, thereby increasing customer lifetime value (CLTV). Additionally, the partnership can drive incremental revenue through cross-promotions and upsells within the games themselves, as players might be incentivized to purchase additional in-game content. This alignment of telecom services with gaming rewards offers a multi-faceted approach to monetization, blending direct sales with enhanced customer retention strategies.
