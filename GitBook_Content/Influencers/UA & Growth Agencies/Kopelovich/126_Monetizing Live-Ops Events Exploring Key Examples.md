Monetizing live-ops events in mobile games has become a sophisticated art, blending player engagement with timely, well-designed offers. Events like *Halloween-themed treasure hunts* and *Snakes and Ladders-inspired challenges* add excitement and create time-limited opportunities for players to progress faster. A core strategy that developers use to enhance monetization during these events is offering special bundles and rolling offers, designed to help players advance while adding value to their in-game purchases. In this article, we continue our exploration with new examples from popular games, showcasing how developers strategically implement event-specific offers to balance player progression with revenue growth.

### “Piggy GO” by Forever9 Games

In this event, *Piggy GO* integrates rewarded video ads as an effective way to boost player engagement while offering free progression options. The event screen presents a tiered reward structure, where players earn increasingly valuable rewards by watching multiple ads. For instance, watching a single video grants a basic reward, while watching six videos unlocks a more substantial bonus. This setup encourages players to engage with multiple ads, providing steady ad revenue for the developer while helping players advance through the event. By strategically placing these rewarded video options, *Piggy GO* achieves a balance between monetization and free-to-play progression, benefiting both the players and the developers.

### “Gossip Harbor” by Microfun

In the *Bingo Bonanza* event, players aim to complete bingo lines, and they can speed up this process with event-specific packs. The screenshot on the right shows three available bundles, each containing gems, coins, and exclusive rewards that accelerate progress. These packs cater to different play styles, allowing players to select the resources that best suit their needs. A strategic addition is the “Buy All” option, which gives players a discount for purchasing all packs together. This feature not only provides added value but also incentivizes higher spending by combining resources for a greater event advantage.

### “Fish of Fortune” by Whalo

In *The Frozen Tale* event, *Fish of Fortune* introduces an enticing offer that encourages players to stay engaged by providing additional spins. As players progress along a winding path, collecting rewards and advancing through stages, they may eventually run out of spins, which are essential for continued progression. The “Keep on Playing” pop-up appears at this critical moment, offering 50 extra spins for a limited-time purchase. This strategic placement makes it an appealing option for players eager to maintain their momentum and complete the event, blending monetization with seamless gameplay progression.

### “Whiteout Survival” by Century Games

In the *Pumpkin Invasion* Halloween event, *Whiteout Survival* offers players a unique way to progress through limited-time holiday content. Players accumulate Treasure Points by battling the Pumpkin Goblin, aiming to climb the ranks and unlock special rewards. To support their journey, the *Halloween Party Pack* is available as a premium bundle, featuring a range of resources including gems, speed-ups, and exclusive avatar frames. This offer provides significant value, boasting a 3000% bonus, which appeals to players looking for a strong advantage in the event. By offering this bundle, *Whiteout Survival* combines thematic content with compelling monetization opportunities, catering to both casual participants and competitive players.

### “Merge Island Merge” by FlyBird

In the *Halloween Ghost Seek* event, *Merge Island* uses a *Snakes and Ladders*-style board, where players spin a wheel to determine how many moves they can make. As they progress through the board, the game offers the “Go Big or Bigger” packs, which provide spins alongside resources like gems and energy for the main game. The choice between packs — with the larger bundle offering 15 spins compared to 5 in the smaller option — allows players to maximize their moves and advance faster. This dual-pack approach gives players flexibility while encouraging investment for those looking to complete the event efficiently. By strategically offering spins within these bundles, *Merge Island* balances core gameplay with event-driven monetization.

### “Coin Master” by Moon Active

In the *Find the Treasure* event, *Coin Master* features a dedicated rolling offer centered around collecting keys, which are essential for unlocking chests and advancing through the event. This rolling offer allows players to purchase bundles that include increasing amounts of keys, each bundle offering additional value and rewards. By structuring the offer as a sequence of deals, players are incentivized to make multiple purchases, enhancing their chances of uncovering exclusive event treasures. This dedicated rolling offer keeps players engaged, encouraging them to progress further in the event while maximizing both engagement and monetization potential.
