###### Subtle Psychology at Play? 🔥🔥🔥

For those unfamiliar, Royal Match’s ‘Lava Quest’ is a time-limited event where players must beat seven consecutive levels without failing once. Only players who clear all seven levels share the grand prize of 10,000 coins, adding a sense of urgency and high stakes to each attempt. Fail a level, and you’re out!  
  
Now, here’s the clever twist: during ‘Lava Quest’, the game uses a lava-themed background for the levels themselves. While it’s mostly covered by the tiles, you can still sense it in the background. This subtle design choice might just create a bit of subconscious pressure—like you don’t want to “fall into the lava” by losing. I can’t help but wonder if this gentle reminder actually pushes players to use boosters or even purchase extra moves if they’re close to failing.   
  
What do you think? Do these subtle cues work on you, or is it just a cool visual detail? Would love to hear your thoughts!
