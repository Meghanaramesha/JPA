##### Welcome back to the game monetization review series. In this edition, we examine “Cup Heroes,” which seems like another potential hybrid win by Voodoo.

This game has recently climbed to the top charts, and for good reason. “Cup Heroes” impressively blends Idle RPG mechanics, such as enemy waves and character upgrades, with hyper-casual elements like multiplier gates, creating a game that feels both fun and complex at the same time.
