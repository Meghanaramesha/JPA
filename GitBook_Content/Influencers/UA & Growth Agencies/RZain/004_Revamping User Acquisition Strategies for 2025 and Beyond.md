Forget everything you knew about user acquisition. The rules have changed, and a new set of tools is creating winners and losers.

The message from AppsFlyer’s keynote was clear: the old playbook of optimizing for last-click and fighting over saturated channels is a fast track to burning budget. The future belongs to UA managers who can answer fundamental questions about true incrementality, cross-platform value, and AI-driven automation.

The innovations announced are foundational shifts that open a massive opportunity for sophisticated UA teams to dramatically outperform their competition. Here’s your strategic guide to the new UA landscape.

1. The Incrementality Revolution: Stop Funding “Credit-Stealers”

![Appsflyer fall release 2025](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQF-sUHJYMVqfQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B4EZqbVBFQHoAU-/0/1763542587610?e=1765411200&v=beta&t=MaFGb9cjOqjPzJVgzXCKvEvp-N5azne94oM2RKWJhSM)

The single most powerful weapon for a UA manager today is Incrementality for User Acquisition.

The Problem: Your attribution dashboard shows installs, but it can’t distinguish between campaigns that drive new users and those that just take credit for them.

The Opportunity: AppsFlyer’s new product turns this unknown into a known variable.

· Real-World Impact: At FuboTV, testing revealed a campaign was not incremental at all, leading to a six-figure monthly budget cut. Conversely, they found winning campaigns to scale with confidence.

· The Bottom Line: AppsFlyer data shows 18% of campaigns generate zero incremental lift, while 30% are 10x more valuable than attributed. This is the most direct path to immediate ROAS improvement.

2. The Omni-Channel LTV Breakthrough: Your Most Valuable Users Are Hiding

![Appsflyer fall release 2025](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHaUGYg-m5VEQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B4EZqbVSXLHMAU-/0/1763542643310?e=1765411200&v=beta&t=Qm49SQ79_sAn3x-OeIugHRG8g7uI-vilQkMp2DWCNrs)

The biggest myth is that a “mobile user” only exists on a phone. The reality is that your highest-value users are multi-platform.

The Problem: A user acquired via CTV who purchases on mobile is often misreported as “organic,” destroying the ROAS of your acquisition campaigns.

The Opportunity: Cross-Platform Journeys and LTV stitches this broken picture together.

· Real-World Impact: Early results are staggering:

· Entertainment Apps: 65% increase in attributed revenue.

· Multi-Platform Games: 27% increase in attributed revenue.

· Overall: Partners report a 48% increase in ROAS.

Your UA Takeaway: Justify higher CPAs on top-of-funnel channels like CTV by capturing the full LTV of the users they drive to any platform.

3. The Signal Advantage: The Mastercard Partnership and the End of “Walled Gardens”

![Appsflyer fall release 2025](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFF4k5QimrGmA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B4EZqbVfsVGoAU-/0/1763542700004?e=1765411200&v=beta&t=U5D9iIf5nmQkgnb859xnuTg-dC3HyuyNHI3svR9QBmA)

In a signal-starved world, the ultimate competitive advantage is access to higher-quality data. This is where the Mastercard partnership and Signal Hub become a UA team’s secret weapon.

The Problem: You’re limited to the targeting options inside walled gardens (Meta, Google). You can’t easily leverage real-world purchase intent data to find high-value users.

The Opportunity: Signal Hub is a privacy-safe data marketplace. With Mastercard as the premier data provider, UA teams can now:

· Target by Real-World Behavior: Create audiences based on aggregated, anonymized purchase data. Think: “Households that spent over $1,000 on travel in the last 3 months” or “Users who made frequent purchases in a competitor’s category.”

· Activate Across Any Channel: These curated audiences are securely pushed to all your activation channels (social, programmatic, CTV), not just one walled garden.

· Measure True Lift: Run A/B tests to see the direct impact of using these premium signals on your campaign ROAS.

Your UA Takeaway: Move beyond basic demographic and interest targeting. You can now acquire users based on verified purchasing power and intent, reaching high-value prospects before they even search and giving you a targeting edge competitors cannot match without this partnership.

4. Creative at Scale: From Chaos to AI-Driven Assembly Line

![Appsflyer fall release 2025](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFfMwcisHgZJA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B4EZqbV.VbKYAU-/0/1763542823761?e=1765411200&v=beta&t=sNoezaImb14IfQJVXfaMeyJbF0i9WQqPbiIUq-cMSBs)

Creative is the king of performance, but managing it is a nightmare. Marketers juggle thousands of creative variations across languages, placements, and campaigns.

The Opportunity: The Creative Management Suite automates the entire creative lifecycle.

· AI-Powered Auto-Tagging & Organization: The system automatically ingests creatives from your Google Drive, analyzes them with AI, and tags them by theme, app, and date. No more manual sorting.

· Pre-Flight Scoring: Before you spend a dollar, AI models analyze each creative and predict its performance potential, allowing you to prioritize winners and avoid losers.

· One-Click Distribution: Upload and deploy a batch of pre-scored creatives to channels like Meta in minutes, not hours.

Your UA Takeaway: This isn’t just an efficiency tool (though it saves dozens of hours). It’s a scale engine. By automating the logistics of creative management, your team can focus on strategy and ideation, testing more concepts, faster, and leveraging AI to ensure the best creatives get the most budget. This has already driven over 200% improvement in marketing efficiency for users.

The New UA Playbook: A Summary

1. Audit for Incrementality: Test your top campaigns. Cut the 18% that are frauds and scale the 30% that are hidden gems.

2. Unify Your LTV View: Integrate cross-platform data to reveal the true ROAS of CTV and web acquisition.

3. Leverage Premium Signals: Use Signal Hub with Mastercard data to target users by real-world purchase intent, breaking your dependence on walled gardens.

4. Automate Creative Scale: Deploy the Creative Suite to systemize testing, predict winners, and distribute creatives autonomously.

The tools for the next era of user acquisition are here. The gap between the UA teams who adopt this full-stack approach and those who don’t will be the defining story of the next growth cycle. The opportunity is to discover a new layer of profitable growth that was previously invisible.
