Hypercasual games are known for their simple mechanics and instant playability, making them extremely popular among mobile gamers. I remember in 2018/19 eight of the top 10 games on the stores were Hypercasual. Today that is changed a bit, but this market is still very competitive. To stand out in this competitive market, creating engaging ad creatives is crucial. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you craft compelling ads for your hypercasual game.

1. **Highlight the Core Gameplay**

The primary appeal of hypercasual games lies in their straightforward and addictive gameplay. Your ad should quickly showcase the core mechanics to capture the viewer’s attention. Highlight what makes your game fun and unique within the first few seconds. Player attention in this games is very short so you need to jump on their screens straight away with pure showcase of your mobile game. 

**Tip:** Use short, snappy clips that demonstrate the gameplay loop. Keep it simple and avoid overloading the viewer with too much information.

2. **Use Eye-Catching Visuals**

Visual appeal is a critical factor in grabbing attention. Use bright colors, bold graphics, and dynamic animations to make your ad stand out. The visuals should be clean and easily understandable at a glance.

**Tip:** Incorporate elements that match your game’s aesthetic and theme. Consistency in style helps build brand recognition and trust.

3. **Incorporate Interactive Elements**

Interactive ads, such as playable ads, allow users to experience a snippet of your game before downloading it. This can significantly increase engagement and conversion rates as users get a taste of the gameplay.

**Tip:** Design a mini-version of your game that can be played within the ad. Make sure it’s intuitive and provides a satisfying experience to entice users to download the full game. If your budget allows, ping me to help you find the best partner to develop your highest quality playable ads. 

4. **Add a Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)**

A strong call-to-action directs viewers on what to do next, whether it’s downloading the game, watching a trailer, or visiting your website. The CTA should be clear, concise, and compelling.

**Tip**: Use action-oriented language such as “Play Now,” “Download Free,” or “Try It Today.” Ensure the CTA button is prominently displayed and easy to tap. However, sometimes I see nowadays some Publishers don’t even use it, but I always recommend using them. 

5. **Test Different Variations**

Creating multiple variations of your ad creatives allows you to test and see which ones perform best. Experiment with different visuals, messages, and formats to identify the most effective combination.

**Tip:** Use A/B testing to compare the performance of different ad versions. Pay attention to metrics like click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates, and user retention to determine success. Most crucial metric to follow Ad performance is IPM, you can find more about it on UA Glossary but here is a short explanation. IPM = Installs per mille. 

6. **Leverage User-Generated Content**

User-generated content (UGC) can add authenticity and trust to your ads. Showcasing real players enjoying your game or sharing their experiences can create a relatable and convincing message.

**Tip:** Encourage your players to share their gameplay videos or reviews. Feature these clips in your ads to build a sense of community and trust. If you don’t have an internal creative team to develop you UGC ads, ping me to connect you with some great people from the industry to develop them.

**Conclusion**

Creating engaging ad creatives for hypercasual games requires a focus on simplicity, visual appeal, and interactivity. By highlighting the core gameplay, using eye-catching visuals, incorporating interactive elements, adding a clear call-to-action, testing different variations, and leveraging user-generated content, you can craft compelling ads that drive downloads and increase player engagement.
