What does it really take to build and lead a game studio that actually ships, without burning people out?

Today, I'm joined by Joni Lappalainen, CEO and Co-founder of Dreamloop Games, who breaks down 10+ years of studio leadership, risk management, sustainable growth, and why overwork culture quietly destroys teams.

We dive into time tracking, “hero complex,” healthy crunch, service leadership, AI myths, mentoring, and what founders consistently get wrong about productivity and success in the game industry.

If you're a game developer, studio founder, producer, or leader who want longevity, not just hype, this episode is for you.
