Want to turn your Discord community into a revenue-generating machine? 

In this episode of The Gaming Playbook, I sit down with Tom Gayner, CEO of Levellr, who’s helped Scopely, Krafton, and even the NFL build high-performing Discord communities. 

We dive into the most common mistakes studios make, why Discord users are 6x more valuable, and how AI is revolutionizing community management.
