In this episode of The Gaming Playbook, I sit down with Peter Fodor, founder and CEO of AppAgent, a top-tier mobile marketing agency behind games from Supercell, Netflix, and Scopely. Peter shares the unfiltered truth about why most mobile games fail to scale, the critical mistakes studios make, and how to win in today's privacy-first, saturated market.

- How to test game ideas *before* writing a single line of code
- The role of creative frameworks and hooks in ad success
- Why LiveOps is the future of monetization
- Managing remote creative teams without losing your mind
- How AI is reshaping mobile game marketing and who should be scared
