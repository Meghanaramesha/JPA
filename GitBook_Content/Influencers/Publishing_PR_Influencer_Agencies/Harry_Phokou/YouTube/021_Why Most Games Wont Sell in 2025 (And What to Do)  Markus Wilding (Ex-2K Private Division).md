Why do most good games still fail today, even with great gameplay?

Markus Wilding – former marketing leader at Take-Two, 2K, and Private Division – joins me to reveal why visibility is now more critical than quality... and how developers and publishers must adapt to survive.

We unpack how outdated marketing playbooks are killing games, why community building is non-negotiable, and the practical strategies every studio needs to market smarter in 2025.

Expect deep dives into:

- Why 90% of marketing strategies are stuck in the past
- How to use influencer marketing correctly in today's market
- How early-stage market validation can save your studio
- How to build community momentum before launch
- Why the future belongs to "snackable fun" games, not bloated AAA
- Practical frameworks for self-auditing your game's marketing readiness

Whether you're an indie developer, publisher, marketer, or founder, this conversation will shift how you approach game success today.
