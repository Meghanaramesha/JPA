In this episode, I sit down with Kate Edwards, CEO of Geogrify, culturalisation strategist, and former Executive Director of the IGDA, to unpack the hidden mistakes developers make when building games for a global audience.

From Age of Empires getting banned in South Korea, to the backlash around Indiana Jones, to why inclusivity and allegorical distance matter more than ever, Kate breaks down the cultural pitfalls that can derail even the biggest titles, and what studios can do to avoid them.

We cover:

- Why culturalisation is critical for global game success
- The real cost of ignoring stereotypes in game worlds
- How allegorical distance helps avoid offensive tropes
- What inclusivity in games looks like beyond tokenism
- The rise of social media backlash and how to handle it
- Lessons from 30+ years across Microsoft, IGDA, and Geogrify

Whether you’re an indie dev, AAA veteran, or just curious about how culture shapes games, this episode is a masterclass in building worlds that truly resonate with players everywhere.
