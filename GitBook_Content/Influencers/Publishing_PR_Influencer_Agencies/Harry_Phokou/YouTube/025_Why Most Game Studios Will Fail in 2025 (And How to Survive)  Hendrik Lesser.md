Today's guest is Hendrik Lesser, president of the European Game Developer Federation and CEO of Remote Control Productions (RCP).

Hendrik started out selling and writing about games before spending nearly five years at Take-Two Interactive. In 2005, he founded Remote Control Productions (RCP), which has grown from a small startup into a global network of 16 studios, shipping over 400 projects. Through RCP, he helps developers focus on making great games while handling business operations, and he continues to advocate for the industry through policy, education, and mentorship.

In this episode, he breaks down the real challenges facing the gaming industry in 2025, from cash flow struggles to why bad business, not bad games, is what really kills studios. He shares hard-earned lessons on studio leadership, competing with old games, and the biggest risks developers need to watch out for. Hendrik also talks about the power of partnerships, how to make remote teams work, and why strong leadership matters more than ever.

Whether you're running a studio, breaking into the industry, or just want a behind-the-scenes look at the business of games, this episode is for you!
