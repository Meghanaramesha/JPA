# The puzzle market might be a red ocean, but it’s far from exhausted.

The puzzle market might be a red ocean, but it’s far from exhausted. Yes, competition is fierce. But there are still plenty of underused mechanics waiting to be explored. And both veterans and new entrants are quietly proving it.

One moment that reshaped my player experience: Toy Blast’s update to the TNT + Rocket combo about a year ago (that you can see in the GIF below). The change, which is unlocked through a win streak, felt like a breath of fresh air. And I’ve been on the lookout for similar implementations ever since.  
  
Match Villains, which I talked about recently, has been the most significant standout lately along these lines. The way they designed Snitch, their version of Propeller, is a great example of puzzle innovation. Propeller is already a unique booster with its target-finding mechanic, but they’ve expanded on it with additional depth that makes each use feel more tactical.

These kinds of auxiliary mechanics are still rare in the wild, but they’re the kinds of small innovations that prove:  
  
🌱 Low-hanging innovation still exists, especially in booster behavior and interactions  
🧪 Experimentation doesn’t have to mean full reinvention and small changes can revitalize core gameplay  
🚀 Both legacy titles and fresh launches are still pushing the market forward  
  
If you’re trying to compete, you can’t afford to stand still. Players notice the details; and innovation, even small, keeps you relevant.
