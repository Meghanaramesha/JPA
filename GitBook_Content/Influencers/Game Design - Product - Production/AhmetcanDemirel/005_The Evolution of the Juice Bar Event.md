# The Evolution of the Juice Bar Event

I’ve talked before about adapting successful ideas from the market. Merge Mansion’s latest event, Mix a Booster, is a great example of just that: Taking a proven event format and evolving it with a sharp monetization twist.

At first glance, it feels familiar. Players mix ingredients to earn rewards like boosters and chests. Sounds a lot like the Juice Bar events we’ve seen in Project Makeover (running since early 2024) and Triple Match 3D (joined the juice club later that year).  
  
These Juice Bars follow a simple formula:  
  
🧩 Play levels → Earn ingredients  
🍹 Mix those ingredients → Create juices  
🎁 Serve the juices → Collect event rewards  
  
Merge Mansion took the same structure and went one step beyond. You start with some ingredients right away. No level grinding required. You explore combinations to unlock recipes with varying rewards. But to actually make anything? You pay. With in-game currency. The more valuable the combo, the more currency it costs to craft.  
  
This changes the Juice Bar from a light progression event to a monetization-centric one. Especially targeting players who are already willing to spend. We don’t have performance data yet, but one thing’s clear: Even well-established event formats can still be disrupted.
