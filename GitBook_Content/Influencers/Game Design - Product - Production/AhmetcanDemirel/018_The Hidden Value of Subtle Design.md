# The Hidden Value of Subtle Design

When discussing the success of a game, we often focus on large features or events. These elements are typically easy to measure with tangible results. We analyze their impact through metrics such as player retention, onboarding success, or spikes in monetization. While these aspects are important, they don’t tell the full story. Subtle design elements can shape the player experience just as significantly, even though their effects are harder to quantify. From encouraging messages to clever animations, these small touches enhance gameplay in ways that keep players engaged.

**The Power of Encouraging Words**
----------------------------------

Some games use text strategically to communicate with players during key moments. These messages can be motivational, celebratory, or even subtly instructional, adding emotional depth to the experience. For example, *Toon Blast* encourages players by displaying a message after completing a challenging level. If the player beats it on the first try, the game informs them of what percentage of other players managed to do the same. This reinforces a sense of mastery, a feeling that resonates strongly with experienced puzzle players who value their skills.

*Candy Crush Saga* uses text messages at multiple points to motivate players. One example is when a player fails a level but is offered extra moves to continue. If the player has a win streak, the game emphasizes its importance by showing what percentage of players chose to purchase extra moves to preserve their streak. [As we discussed before](https://www.gamigion.com/win-streak-gift-that-keeps-on-giving/), win streaks are a major motivator for puzzle players, and this gentle nudge cleverly ties the messaging to a key gameplay element.

*Candy Crush Saga* displaying the win streak with a message encouraging the use of extra moves to maintain it.

Another clever use of text in *Candy Crush Saga* involves highlighting rewards during gameplay. As players advance through a level, they’re reminded of the golden crown they can earn by completing it on the first try. This subtle reminder shown in the middle of a level builds anticipation for the reward, increasing player motivation without disrupting their focus.

These well-timed and thoughtfully crafted messages go beyond mere communication: **they create a dialogue between the game and the player**. By subtly reinforcing progress, encouraging perseverance, or highlighting rewards, these textual cues add emotional depth and a sense of connection. In doing so, they ensure players feel seen and supported, fostering a more engaging and rewarding gameplay experience.

**Emotional Engagement Through Characters**
-------------------------------------------

In many puzzle games, central characters add a personal touch by reacting to gameplay. These characters often display emotions that mirror the player’s journey, creating a deeper emotional connection. In *Royal Match* and *Toon Blast*, for example, the main character observes the board and reacts to matches in real time. Their facial expressions change based on the player’s progress. If a player is struggling near the end of a level with limited moves remaining, the character may look worried. Conversely, successful matches bring smiles or celebratory gestures.

*Toon Blast* goes a step further by customizing the character during special events. In the “Dragon Treasure” event, the character dons a helmet, reinforcing the theme of the competition and deepening the player’s immersion. **These small touches, while hard to measure in isolation, contribute to the overall sense of fun and connection**.

In addition to changing the level background, the main character is also customized for event participation in *Toon Blast*.

Additionally, *Candy Crush Saga* combines the use of their main character with subtle motivational cues through texts during levels. Phrases like “So close!” appear in the upper corner of the screen when players are making progress through a hard level. Though unobtrusive, this kind of feedback creates a sense of acknowledgment and encouragement.

By integrating character reactions into gameplay, these games add a layer of emotional resonance that enhances the player’s journey. These subtle interactions make the experience feel personal and dynamic, transforming static mechanics into a shared adventure. While easy to overlook, these small details significantly contribute to the sense of fun and connection that keeps players invested.

**Easing the Player’s Cognitive Burden**
----------------------------------------

While many subtle design elements operate in the background, some implementations bring subtlety into the spotlight, offering clear and direct assistance to players. These examples highlight how thoughtful visual feedback can guide player actions and enhance the overall gameplay experience.

*Match Factory* is an excellent example of this approach. As a Physical Match game, its core mechanic involves finding and selecting items scattered across the center of the screen. To assist players, the game uses small animations on the target card at the top of the screen. When a player collects an item tied to the level’s goal, the target card bounces slightly, offering immediate and visible feedback.

In contrast, collecting non-target items causes no change, helping players intuitively differentiate between relevant and irrelevant actions. This subtle feedback is especially valuable given the game’s constraints, which are limited time and space to make matches. The animation serves a critical purpose: it conveys that a collected item contributes to progress, **reducing the mental effort players might otherwise expend on keeping track**.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdUhL30oTOC_t6oIUANgnw8nAT40uZq-_j3J29zR9Eh43fYjFGyN8LAod4l-TwbZLalgtVW8UGfUJwPWf5mc1vbuOfkEDtQgrL8wMJlpEdZY6KyLM72xK5SZVN0GkruGzwk82eQ_A?key=ccwVXC-ECnVAYAgIKFrwo4gd)

In *Match Factory*, the target items are clear even if you don’t look at the target cards while you have to check the top in *Triple Match 3D*.

A direct comparison with *Triple Match 3D* underscores the importance of this design choice. Both games share similar mechanics, yet *Triple Match 3D* omits these auxiliary animations, opting instead to only update the numerical counter on the target card when a goal item is selected. This minor omission increases cognitive load, requiring players to actively monitor the counter. By contrast, *Match Factory*’s animations streamline the experience, making gameplay feel more intuitive and enjoyable. Although it doesn’t cover significant space or priority on the screen, this subtle help goes a long way in making the player’s life easy in the long term.

A similar approach can be observed in *Gossip Harbor*, which also has [a great deconstruction](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog/2024/8/19/finding-genre-success-the-case-of-gossip-harbor) if you want to learn more about it. Like other Merge games, *Gossip Harbor* lets its players interact with various producers that generate items. Each producer can create multiple types of items, each with varying production rates. Some items are more common, while others are rare and harder to produce.

To enhance the experience, *Gossip Harbor* introduces a feature that I would like to call “lucky moments.” When a rare item is produced, the game plays a short animation of a gift box appearing on the screen. This animation lasts only about half a second with limited space, but it creates a delightful surprise for players. Over time, it reinforces the perceived value of rare items, making these moments feel special and rewarding.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe143W5RevOjMAhSM6sMwj5YSXB3uDsLq9b21SP9vCbbkEKHrachQN1OjMi6KLCPTeAP36DmwqzZ8xDiUVmB6qVLPaJnQkGxoO-ufFEhrwCXcS5RV3fU8c8vcat1i4t7cxYzsb5Ig?key=ccwVXC-ECnVAYAgIKFrwo4gd)

A delightful moment in *Gossip Harbor* unfolds as you first spot the gift box, followed by the reveal of a rare, high-level item.

This animation is more than just a flourish, but it ties into the core gameplay loop. Merge games often rely on players repeating tasks to achieve specific goals, and adding a layer of excitement to these rare moments helps break the monotony. While the basic mechanic of rare item generation exists in nearly all Merge games, *Gossip Harbor* elevates it by integrating this thoughtful and visually engaging feature.

By leveraging subtle animations to provide clear and immediate feedback, these games reduce the mental strain on players while amplifying their sense of progress and achievement. Whether it’s distinguishing target items in *Match Factory* or celebrating rare finds in *Gossip Harbor*, **these thoughtful touches make gameplay more intuitive, rewarding, and memorable**. In an environment where every second counts, these small design choices deliver outsized value, ensuring players feel supported and engaged at every step.

**Small Details, Big Impact**
-----------------------------

Data-informed iterations are the backbone of a successful game. They provide critical insights into player behavior, reveal opportunities for improvement, and drive measurable changes that enhance a game’s performance. Focusing on clearly measured metrics is essential for ensuring a game remains competitive and aligned with player expectations.

However, while data provides the foundation, **it’s the subtle design touches that often define a game’s emotional resonance and long-term appeal**. Motivational messages, engaging character interactions, and intuitive animations may not show immediate, tangible results in performance charts, but they collectively shape how players feel about a game. These design choices foster connection, delight, and immersion, keeping players engaged well beyond the initial data-driven optimizations.

The true art of game development lies in balancing these two forces. By pairing data-informed improvements with the thoughtful implementation of subtle design elements, teams can create experiences that are both analytically robust and emotionally compelling. This combination not only ensures short-term success but also builds the kind of loyalty and satisfaction that makes players return again and again.
