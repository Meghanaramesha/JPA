# Sometimes, a single gold bar makes all the difference.

Here’s a fun one.

I was all set to log into Candy Crush Soda Saga to grab my daily reward and play some levels, business as usual. Then I realized… I forgot to play yesterday. It’s easy to keep up with your daily games when you’re cozy at home. But when you’re on the road, at an event in another country? Routines crumble.

As someone who’s been playing for over a year straight, it hurt to see that login streak disappear. I’ve played a ton of puzzle games over the years, but that was the moment I felt closest to making a purchase. (Well, aside from those heart-pounding moments when my win streak is under threat, but that’s a story for another time.)  
  
The game offered me a lifeline: I could get my streak back for just 9 gold bars. Considering the End Game Offer for extra moves costs 10 bars, this felt like an incredible deal. But of course there was a catch: I had only 8.  
  
As I was going through this emotional roller coaster within mere seconds, I tapped to buy anyway. And what happened next? The game sent me right to the shop, where it had curated offers ready to go. It knew. And it worked. I converted immediately. That streak? Still going strong.  
  
This moment might not be a major monetization needle-mover for Candy Crush Soda Saga, but it’s a brilliant example of being ready for different kinds of player needs and emotions. Not every game will have a login streak worth saving, but what’s your equivalent feature? What’s the low-effort, high-impact way you can catch a player at just the right time?  
  
Because sometimes, a single gold bar makes all the difference.
