# The Sweet Art of Feature Adaptation

In the ever-evolving landscape of the gaming industry, it’s no secret that games often draw inspiration from one another. This cross-pollination of ideas isn’t confined to a single genre or platform; it’s a universal phenomenon that drives innovation continuously. Whether it’s a unique gameplay mechanic from an indie title or a groundbreaking event in one of the biggest franchises, developers consistently look to each other to spark creativity and fuel progress.

When a new feature or event makes waves in a particular game, it’s only natural for others within the same genre to take notice. After all, if something resonates with players, why not explore its potential in a similar context? However, in a world where game updates are dissected in real-time by every other developer, keeping such innovations under wraps has become virtually impossible. The moment you introduce a new element, it’s out there for everyone to see, analyze, and, yes, adapt.  
  
But here’s the catch: simply copying a feature or event from a competitor doesn’t guarantee success. Each game has its systems, player base, and identity. What works seamlessly in one game might feel out of place in another. That’s why it’s essential not just to follow what others are doing, but to **thoughtfully integrate new ideas in a way that aligns with your game’s unique vision and your players’ expectations**.

Staying informed about industry trends is more than just keeping up with the Joneses—it’s about continuous growth and improvement. There’s always something new to learn, a fresh perspective to consider, or an innovative mechanic to experiment with. However, the real challenge lies in adaptation rather than imitation. It’s about finding that sweet spot where a borrowed idea becomes a natural extension of your game, enhancing the player experience without compromising your original design.

**How to Swiftly Adapt**
------------------------

Sometimes, game developers choose to adopt a “copy and paste” approach when they spot a successful feature in a competitor’s game, especially if there’s a significant overlap between their target audiences. In such cases, it might be wise not to spend too much time reinventing the wheel. If a feature is already out there, proving its success in the market, bringing it into your own game promptly can be a smart move.

A great example of this is how *Toon Blast* implemented the Super Light Ball shortly after it was introduced in *Royal Match*. *Toon Blast* integrated the feature into their game without any significant changes just three months after *Royal Match* released it. They didn’t tweak it or try to make it their own—they recognized its value and delivered it directly to their players.

This quick turnaround allowed *Toon Blast* to capitalize on the feature’s performance uplift without losing much time. Other games eventually followed suit, implementing the same feature about a year after *Royal Match* did. However, most of them did so without changing anything after all.

Adopting a successful feature directly from a competitor isn’t about lacking creativity; **it’s about understanding your audience and delivering what they enjoy**. When the feature aligns well with your game’s mechanics and your players’ preferences, a swift and faithful implementation can enhance the gaming experience without unnecessary delays.

In a fast-paced industry where everyone can see what others are doing in real time, being a super-fast follower can sometimes be more advantageous than trying to devise a unique spin on a proven idea. It’s all about recognizing when to innovate and when to efficiently adopt what’s already working.

**Adapting, Not Copying: Making Features Your Own**
---------------------------------------------------

While some games decide that a direct, one-to-one adaptation is the best route, others prefer to put their spin on a new feature before fully embracing it. This approach allows them to integrate the feature more seamlessly into their existing game mechanics and maintain the delicate balance that keeps their players engaged.

Take *Candy Crush Saga*, for example. They recently introduced their version of the Super Light Ball. However, unlike other games that implemented the feature almost identically sooner or later, *Candy Crush Saga* opted for a different version. In their game, the Super Light Ball is available to players only for a single day unless they lose a level, and its effect lasts for just the first three moves of a level.

*Candy Crush Saga*with arguably the best Super Light Ball design so far…

This cautious adaptation might stem from concerns about the level of difficulty and how the feature could impact overall win rates. In puzzle games, maintaining a balanced difficulty curve is crucial because it directly affects player satisfaction and the frequency of end-game offers (EGOs) that appear when a player fails a level. By limiting the power and availability of this feature, *Candy Crush Saga* can introduce an exciting new element without disrupting its finely-tuned game balance.

Another example of this customized approach is seen in *Merge Mansion* with their handling of the Supercharge feature. Supercharge acts as an accelerator in Merge games, doubling the energy consumption of item generators in exchange for producing higher-level items. For a long period, *Merge Mansion* didn’t include this feature at all while it has been utilized by games like *Gossip Harbo*r and *Travel Town*. For more information on how Merge Games adapted this feature from social casino games, you can check out [Jesper Gustavsson’s great deconstruction of *Gossip Harbor*](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/blog/2024/8/19/finding-genre-success-the-case-of-gossip-harbor).

*Gossip Harbor*(left) lets players double the stakes permanently while *Merge Mansion*(right) using it as an event.

Recently, *Merge Mansion* started offering Supercharge, but only as a time-limited event rather than a permanent game mechanic. This limited availability allows them to test the feature’s impact on gameplay and player engagement without fully committing to it. It also creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging players to participate while the event is active.

It’s fascinating to see how different development teams approach the same feature in varied ways. While one game might opt for a full-scale implementation, another might introduce it cautiously, tailoring it to fit its unique structure. These customized adaptations highlight the importance of not just following industry trends, but thoughtfully integrating them in a way that aligns with a game’s core design and player expectations.

As these games continue to evolve, it’ll be interesting to observe how their versions of these common features develop over time. Will *Candy Crush Saga* expand the availability of the Super Light Ball? Will *Merge Mansion* make Supercharge permanent? Regardless of the outcome, they exemplify a group of developers who prioritize adaptation over imitation, proving that sometimes the best way to stay ahead is to make a trend uniquely your own.

**Pilot Testing Through Other Games**
-------------------------------------

Another method that games use when adapting features from others involves leveraging your second-tier titles within your portfolio. This strategy allows developers to test and refine new features in one game before rolling them out to their flagship titles. It’s a way to mitigate risk while still staying competitive in the market.

Magic Tavern serves as a prime example of this approach. With two scaled Match-3 titles under their belt—*Matchington Mansion* and *Project Makeover*—they’ve used *Matchington Mansion* as a sort of early adopter for new features. For instance, *Matchington Mansion* has been utilizing the Propeller power-up and the Super Light Ball feature for quite some time, whereas *Project Makeover* did not include either of these features for a longer period.

*Matchington Mansion* (top) and *Project Makeover* (bottom), offer the same feature with slightly different requirements.

The Propeller power-up was added to *Project Makeover* last spring, and with the recent inclusion of the Super Light Ball, the game has caught up with *Matchington Mansion* and the rest of the market regarding these popular features. The team likely observed strong results from these two features in their older title, which influenced their decision to implement them in their crown jewel.

Playrix appears to be on a similar path with its portfolio. In games that share the same mechanics—*Fishdom* and *Gardenscapes*—the Super Light Ball update was introduced in *Fishdom* a while ago, but *Gardenscapes* has yet to receive it. Although the gap between these two games isn’t as pronounced as between *Matchington Mansion* and *Project Makeover*, one might speculate that Playrix is monitoring the feature’s performance in *Fishdom*before introducing it to *Gardenscapes*.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58af450eb3db2b0582612f1d/a113b50a-7515-4f38-a32c-965423e34590/5.png)

*Homescapes* (top) and Fishdom (bottom) already received their updates, likely providing data for *Gardenscapes* to follow them.

Moreover, the fact that *Homescapes* has already received this update might provide additional data points for Playrix. Despite *Homescapes* having slightly different mechanics, the insights gained from both games could help Playrix determine whether implementing the Super Light Ball in *Gardenscapes* would benefit.

Using secondary titles as testing grounds allows developers to fine-tune features and gauge player reactions without risking the equilibrium of their most successful games. It’s a thoughtful way to innovate while safeguarding the player experience that has made their flagship titles so popular.

**Final Thoughts**
------------------

In the dynamic world of game development, drawing inspiration from others is not just common—it’s a driving force behind innovation. However, the difference between success and mediocrity often hinges on how developers adapt these borrowed ideas. Simply copying a feature from a competitor doesn’t guarantee it will resonate with your audience.

Some developers opt for swift adaptation, quickly integrating popular features to meet player expectations and stay competitive. Others take a more cautious approach, customizing and tailoring new features to align with their game’s mechanics and balance. Then some strategically test new ideas in secondary titles before rolling them out to their flagship games. These varied approaches highlight a fundamental truth: thoughtful integration is more valuable than reflexive imitation.

Understanding your audience and the core identity of your game is crucial when adapting new features. It’s not just about staying current with industry trends but about enhancing the player experience in a way that feels authentic to your game. By tailoring new ideas to fit seamlessly within your existing framework, you maintain the delicate balance that keeps players engaged and satisfied.

Ultimately, innovation in gaming isn’t just about the ideas you adopt—**it’s about how you make them resonate with your players**. By finding the right way of adaptation, you not only keep your game relevant but also enrich the player experience as a whole.
