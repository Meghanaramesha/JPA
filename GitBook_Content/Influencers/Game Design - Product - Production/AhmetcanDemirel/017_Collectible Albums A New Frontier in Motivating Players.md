# Collectible Albums: A New Frontier in Motivating Players

Casual games succeed by offering straightforward mechanics that are easy to grasp but challenging to master. However, this simplicity can present a challenge for developers. Over time, it becomes increasingly difficult to introduce new features that boost engagement and monetization without compromising the game’s streamlined experience. Many developers have tried to introduce ambitious, intricate mechanics only to discover that these alienate their audience rather than delight them.

In recent years, a new solution has gained momentum across the casual gaming space: **collectible albums**. Games like *Monopoly Go*, *Royal Match*, and *Gossip Harbor* have embraced these mechanics, creating highly engaging live events that revolve around collecting virtual cards. Players earn, trade, and complete albums in pursuit of rewards, badges, or bragging rights. Collectible albums have become a key tool for developers to add new layers of motivation and replayable content to their games, all without disrupting the core gameplay.

**What Are Collectible Albums?**
--------------------------------

The idea of collectible albums has deep roots in physical and tabletop gaming. Any football fan familiar with Panini sticker books or trading card game enthusiasts familiar with games like Pokémon will instantly recognize the appeal. These systems tap into players’ intrinsic desire to collect, trade, and complete sets, which is a concept that translates seamlessly to casual mobile games.

Panini sticker books (left) and Pokémon cards (right) have been around for a very long time.

In a mobile game context, collectible albums are usually introduced as LiveOps events, typically running for a limited time such as one or two months. Players collect cards through various in-game activities such as playing the core game, participating in events, or making in-app purchases. Each album consists of smaller sets, often requiring players to collect nine cards per set. The cards themselves are categorized by rarity, which adds another layer of depth.

The mechanic doesn’t just add a layer of collection, but it also introduces an entirely new progression system. Players are incentivized to complete sets or albums to unlock exclusive rewards, often tailored to enhance the core gameplay. With multiple rarity tiers and a constant influx of different sets to complete, **these events provide a near-endless source of engagement**.

**The Appeal of Collectible Albums**
------------------------------------

On the surface, collectible albums might seem like an expensive feature to maintain as producing them regularly is the embodiment of being on a content treadmill. They require a steady stream of new assets, themes, and mechanics to keep players engaged. However, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Collectible albums work exceptionally well in casual games because they align perfectly with player psychology and the economics of mobile gaming. Let’s break down why they’re so effective:

### **1. A fresh source of motivation**

Casual games often revolve around a single core mechanic such as matching tiles, merging items, or building structures. Over time, even the most engaging mechanics can feel repetitive. This is why LiveOps has become increasingly important. They are there to create new sources of motivation that keep players engaged with the core gameplay loop. However, while many successful games have crafted extensive LiveOps calendars, they all face a common limitation: most LiveOps events end up catering to the same intrinsic motivation, such as competition, mastery, or in-game rewards.

For example, leaderboard-based events push players to climb the ranks by playing more of the core gameplay, which ultimately caters to the competitive spirit of certain players. Similarly, time-limited tournaments often incentivize players to perform better by earning higher scores in levels, which again ties back to a drive for mastery and accomplishment. Even simple progression events are directly focused on the immediate rewards that players will receive.

This repetition, while effective, eventually saturates player interest. This is where collectible albums shine: **they introduce a fresh, secondary layer of motivation**. By giving players new goals such as collecting unique cards or completing rare sets, collectible albums enrich the gameplay experience without disrupting the simplicity of the core mechanics. This distinct form of motivation appeals to a broader range of players, particularly completionists and social players, while revitalizing engagement across the entire player base.

*Royal Match* gives out a badge for finishing each new collection and it helps the most engaged players distinguish themselves.

For example, in *Royal Match*, completing an album awards players with a collection badge. This badge is prominently displayed on their profile, **giving them a sense of accomplishment and status**. Such rewards may seem minor, but for many players, they are deeply meaningful and a strong incentive to engage with future album events.

### **2. Creating rewarding gameplay loops**

Beyond the intrinsic joy of collecting, collectible albums excel because they offer clear, tangible rewards for players. Completing a card set typically grants boosts, power-ups, or in-game currency that directly ties back to the core gameplay. This creates a self-sustaining loop: players engage with the core gameplay to collect cards, use those cards to unlock rewards, and then reinvest those rewards into further gameplay. It’s a beautifully circular system that reinforces player engagement.

This approach differs from traditional progression events that are directly tied to in-game rewards because players must first engage with the collectible album layer before accessing those rewards. This additional layer makes the entire experience far more engaging, even though the ultimate rewards may be similar. Furthermore, the tiered rarity of cards introduces natural milestones for players to pursue. Completing a set of common cards offers a satisfying sense of achievement, but completing a set that includes rare or legendary cards? That’s a true accomplishment, often accompanied by exclusive rewards that make the effort feel especially worthwhile.

### **3. Fostering Social Connections**

Collectible albums also introduce a powerful social component. Because players acquire card packs rather than individual cards, duplicates are inevitable. This creates an opportunity for trading, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among players.

Different games handle trading mechanics in unique ways. In *Monopoly Go*, players can trade directly with friends, but the lack of a dedicated trading system has led to the growth of massive online communities. For example, the game’s Facebook trading group has over nine million members (!), demonstrating the mechanic’s ability to drive social engagement.

9 million members with 10,000 new posts every day. Talk about social gameplay…

On the other hand, *Royal Match* recently integrated trading directly into its group chat system. Players can request specific cards from their group members, making the process seamless and reinforcing the bonds within in-game social groups. This feature caters especially well to more socially inclined players, adding another layer of engagement.

**How to Implement Collectible Albums Successfully**
----------------------------------------------------

Introducing a collectible album feature isn’t as simple as copying what’s worked for others. Execution is critical as seen in the case of *Candy Crush Soda Saga*’s short-lived “Soda Cards” event in 2024. While the event had potential, technical issues undermined its performance, and it hasn’t returned to the game since. This doesn’t mean the event must have underperformed for *Candy Crush Soda Saga* and it will never be back again, but it underscores the importance of proper planning and flawless execution.

Soon after the release of their collectible album called “Soda Cards”, the game had to release this community update due to the consistent issues the event created…

Here are a few best practices for implementing collectible albums:

### **1. Streamlined Content Creation**

Maintaining a steady flow of fresh content is crucial to the success of collectible albums. The more diverse and visually appealing the albums, the more likely players are to remain engaged over time. Designing and producing an album from start to finish will be a time-intensive process, but generative AI tools may offer a way to streamline certain aspects. Particularly in the concept creation phase, they can significantly reduce the time required to brainstorm themes, generate early concepts, or develop initial ideas.

### **2. Options for Non-Social Players**

Not every player wants to trade cards or interact with others. To cater to these players, games should include alternative systems for managing duplicates. For example, many games allow players to exchange extra cards for in-game currency or other rewards. This ensures that all players, regardless of their social habits, can progress meaningfully.

### **3. Balancing Accessibility and Challenge**

A successful collectible album system strikes the right balance between accessibility and challenge. Early sets should be easy enough to hook players while later sets should present a meaningful challenge that rewards dedication. This should be no stranger to experienced teams, but it’s still worth mentioning.

**The Future of Collectible Albums**
------------------------------------

Collectible albums have proven to be a powerful tool for introducing new sources of motivation without altering a game’s core mechanics. Since sustaining engagement relies on continuously offering players those new sources of motivation, it’s no surprise that more and more games are embracing this feature. As long as developers seek innovative ways to keep players invested, collectible albums will continue to grow in popularity.

What makes this trend even more exciting is the potential for evolution. As we’ve seen with different teams adapting the same mechanic in unique ways, future iterations of collectible albums will likely inspire even more creative approaches to player motivation. **The key to success will be ensuring that these events are well-executed, providing players with a steady stream of high-quality content that keeps them engaged over time**. Those who strike the right balance between novelty and consistency will reap the rewards of a truly compelling LiveOps feature.
