# How LiveOps Events Can Help Games Reach Wider Audiences

The gaming industry has long embraced the idea that games don’t just compete with each other, but they compete with all forms of entertainment. But we may be crossing into an even more complex era. Entertainment is no longer just competition; it’s becoming collaboration. The success of the Minecraft movie, with its impressive box office debut and [a viral TikTok trend of its own](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/09/cinemas-minecraft-movie-chicken-jockey-tiktok-trend), is the latest proof that entertainment formats are increasingly blending.

Just like how that single standout moment in the movie became more iconic than the movie itself, what we remember most about our favorite shows or films often isn’t the overarching plot. It’s the specific elements that resonated with us. For some, it’s a particular character. And not even always the lead one. Fandoms are often built around supporting roles that strike a chord with audiences; sometimes even more so than the main protagonists. The Simpsons is a great example. While the Simpson family is iconic, characters like Mr. Burns or Ned Flanders have carved out fanbases of their own and become just as memorable.

Chicken jockey, anyone?

And in this new world of cross-medium engagement, games are held to the same standard regarding the amount and depth of content. What used to be all about core gameplay and moment-to-moment fun has evolved. Now, it’s just as much about how you continue delivering fresh and engaging experiences over time. Your lead character (meaning your core gameplay) still plays the starring role, and you absolutely need to keep building around it. But that alone isn’t enough anymore. You also need to introduce new sources of engagement that speak to different player motivations.

That’s exactly where LiveOps comes in and why it’s been steadily taking up more space in the spotlight over the past few years. Through well-designed live events, developers can broaden the appeal of their game by **catering not only to their core audience but also to a range of adjacent player types**. While LiveOps includes a variety of elements, this article focuses on two key levers: single-player and multiplayer events. These are not just content drops. They’re strategic tools to extend the reach and relevance of your game.

**Single-Player Events: Building Personal Paths to Progression**
----------------------------------------------------------------

If your game is primarily a single-player experience, adding single-player events is one of the most effective ways to give players more reasons to keep coming back. These events often revolve around introducing new progression paths, offering fresh goals and incentives that expand beyond the core loop and reignite motivation to play.

One of the most effective methods is introducing mini-games, [which we recently wrote about](https://www.gamigion.com/engaging-mini-games-and-where-to-find-them/), that break away from the main mechanics while staying within the same universe. *Monopoly GO!* has shown how powerful this can be, and the puzzle genre has been following suit with its own unique spins. These experiences aren’t meant to replace the core gameplay. Instead, they serve as short, refreshing detours that rekindle interest. Importantly, access to mini-games is often gated by resources earned from the core loop. That means players engage more with the main game to access the new content. A perfect flywheel.

But mini-games aren’t the only way to inject fresh energy. Short-term progression events, the ones tracked by a time-limited progress bar, are another solid tool. These often hinge on simple mechanics like collecting a specific item or maximizing the efficiency of your run (e.g., bonus rewards for extra moves or leftover lives). From a design perspective, you’re rewarding the same behaviors you already value. **But by wrapping them in a time-sensitive challenge, you create a compelling micro-goal that adds urgency and novelty.** It also taps into our brain’s craving for constant progression and quick feedback loops, adding a bonus effect where the act of progressing becomes rewarding in and of itself.

*Monopoly GO!* using several short-term progression events to reward players.

Then there are collectible albums, [that we also talked about before](https://www.gamigion.com/collectible-albums-a-new-frontier-in-motivating-players/), which are becoming a staple for games with highly engaged audiences. These appeal directly to “collector” player types, who are motivated by ownership and completion. When these albums are time-limited and tied to permanent cosmetic rewards like profile frames or badges, the value goes up significantly. Not only do players get to keep something forever, they also get to show it off.

And here’s the kicker: even though collectible albums are often structured as single-player features, they frequently evolve into social experiences. The moment a player starts missing just one or two rare cards, trading becomes essential. This transition from solo grind to social strategy makes albums one of the most versatile tools in the LiveOps playbook.

**Multiplayer Events: Pitting Your Players Against Each Other**
---------------------------------------------------------------

Single-player engagement is just one side of the coin. Over the past few years, multiplayer events have gained traction even in games that aren’t traditionally social. From puzzle games to casino titles, it’s now common to see at least one (and often several) events where players either compete against each other or team up toward a shared goal. As mentioned earlier, collectible albums are a great example where cooperation through trading becomes essential to progression.

Collectible albums may be a great example of a light multiplayer event, but it doesn’t stop there. *Monopoly GO!*, again, has been leading the charge in the casual market by designing events explicitly around partnering, where players team up to reach shared milestones. This cooperative mechanic has become so effective that it’s now a regular part of every successful casual game’s LiveOps rotation.

While cooperative gameplay can be a hit with part of your audience, there’s always another group that thrives on competition and the chance to outplay others. To serve that audience, **time-limited leaderboards** remain one of the most effective solutions. Whether it’s a weekly race for points or a flash event with specific objectives, competitive events let your most driven players flex their skills and feel recognized.

If you want to blend these two motivations, cooperation and competition, you can go even further with team-based events. These are especially potent if your game supports clans or guilds. When teams go head-to-head, players don’t just show up; they organize. They plan their playtime, they optimize their spending, and they become deeply invested in the outcome. What starts as a timed event turns into a full-blown community moment.

By layering in social mechanics, from casual trading to structured team competition, you create more reasons for more players to participate, regardless of their preferred playing style.

**The Real Power of Variety: Establishing Routine Through Differentiation**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, what’s the big picture here? LiveOps isn’t just about giving players something new. **It’s about creating cadence.** When your event calendar includes a diverse mix of solo challenges, cooperative missions, and competitive showdowns, different segments of your audience start to develop routines around your game. Some may log in religiously for a leaderboard event, while others wait patiently for their favorite mini-game to return.

While most players will stick to their usual play patterns, offering a diverse range of events creates spikes in activity. Each driven by players showing up for the events they enjoy most. Over time, these personalized routines aggregate into something powerful: a game that’s buzzing with activity across different player types at different times. The result? More play sessions, more monetization windows, and ultimately, more longevity for your game.

And while this article focused on single and multiplayer events, the broader principle applies to all LiveOps design. If you want to grow your audience, go beyond your core. Cater to collectors, grinders, socializers, and competitors alike. Give them reasons to stay, and reasons to come back. Because in an entertainment landscape where everyone’s vying for attention, variety isn’t just nice to have. It’s the only way to stay in the game.
