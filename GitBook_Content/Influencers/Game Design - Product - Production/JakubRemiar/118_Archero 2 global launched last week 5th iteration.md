# Archero 2 global launched last week: 5th iteration

###### Archero 2 by Habby global launched last week and with it, the 5th iteration 😁 of the passive power progression side system.

This has been iterated over 5 years from the days of Archero 1(2019). Capybara GO and [Survivor.io](http://Survivor.io) have a more complex version of this system unlocked much later, but Archero 2 simplified it and put it into the early game, replacing the infinite “upgrade” button. Now the button is even called “gacha” 😅 as the whole thing feels like a collectible album with various rarities. In the end it is just a much more randomized and high production visualisation of the passive power 💪 progression system.  
  
It is very intriguing to see these different iterations done within the same studio and genre, launched very close to each other. Will Archero 2 compete with Capybara GO? I can’t wait to do a deep dive review of this game with Matej & Felix.   
  
Anyone getting the same vibes from the game as in 5 years ago?It’s really hard btw 🤣.I really like the new skills they added especially the sprites and the meteors 😎.
