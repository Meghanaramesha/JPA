☢️ Warning heavy knowledge podcast ahead ☢️

Rogue-lite “run imprints” is the most exciting mechanic in the genre for me, evolving it to another level, get the explanation here 😎

This iteration essentially captures a snapshot of your character build at the end of the run and preserves it in a “catalogue” like fashion for later usage in metagame side modes of the game. This gives runs completely different dynamic, as you are not just grinding endlessly the same build again and again, but you could literally improve your character if you are lucky for further usage in the whole game 😲. And of course you usually need to create multiple imprints for the same character as if sides modes are build correctly, they require different builds with each single one 😅.  
  
This was pioneered by Uma Musume Pretty Derby 🏇, one of the only Japanese games that is very strong in the west even in its fully original Japanese form, not even counting in their steam version. Next game we have seen this is Chaos Zero Nightmare, which uses Slay the Spire as its core, but lets you use the “save data” of a deck of your character in the metagame.

I am excited 🤩 for more games using this mechanic, as rogue-lite is one of the most vibrant genres on the market currently and we see constant hits in it, even on PC with games like Balatro, Megabonk and Ball x Pit.
