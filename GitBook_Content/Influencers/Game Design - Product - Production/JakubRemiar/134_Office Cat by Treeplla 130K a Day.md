# Office Cat by Treeplla: $130K a Day

Office Cat by [treeplla Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/treeplla-inc./) already scaled to $130K a day 🤑 overall revenue just in 4 months. In this special episode, we got Seok Kang, CPO at Treeplla to live review the game with us. The company has a lot of cat-themed games such as Cat Snack Bar, Lumbercat, Cat Mart in their portfolio so this is not a “Catccident” 😹.  
  
Even though Office Cat can be considered an idle game, it has a unique loop compared to the usual idler. There is no reset mechanic, as your office just moves to bigger buildings 🏢 with all the progression. This was an iteration on one of the biggest churn points of the genre, which is the lost progress during reset. You essentially manage a co-working space, where companies grow and pay rent (names such as KitTok, and Spawtify 😹). You get more and more rare companies with more and more office space requirements.  
  
On top of it, there is a lot of management involved, such as electricity mechanics, maintenance, bathrooms, meeting rooms, etc. This determines the morale of the employees, which then makes companies grow faster. This setup pushes quite hard into hard currency 💎 as some required office furniture can be only bought with it 🙀. Later a factory is introduced with a secondary core gameplay, where you need to manage the usual farm recipe production puzzle. In the meantime you also need to buy expensive houses and fancy cars to increase your Rich Cat index and share your lavish life on Catstagram, so you can take on Melon Mask 😹.  
  
The ad placements are done very well with some unique ones such as the daily stock investment, mission rewards multiplier, and mystery cat, turning night into day 😸 The game is the 3rd biggest in the tycoon/ crafting downloads category right after Playrix’s Township and Supercell’s Hay Day and it can be also seen on its great UA strategy. Thanks again Seok for coming on the podcast and sharing so many insights and real numbers behind the game 👍.
