Acecraft by [MOONTON GAMES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moontongames/) scaled to $300K 🤑 a day in revenue during first week and is already their second biggest game. With a unique art style and IP collaboration it is an instant mobile hit, read the latest here 😎:

The game takes inspiration from Cuphead, ☕ the 2017 PC indie hit, which also used this unique art style based on 1930’s golden age of American animation. The combat, the menus and even basic interaction is all done in this specific style giving the game a giant differentiator advantage. There is nothing like this on mobile yet. On top of this they global launched with Tom & Jerry 😼 🐭 IP collaboration, which fits perfectly. You can get them both from a limited gacha banner together with their weapons, of course they cost literally hundreds of dollars to get 💸.   
  
The core gameplay is a vertical scroll Shoot ’em Up, where you control your plane 🛩️ and destroy enemies on the screen, while selecting abilities in between the waves in typical Roguelite ARPG fashion. The great innovation they did it in the core is that you can actually counter the enemy projectiles by absorbing them with release button and throwing them back at enemies. The metagame itself is anchored around the usual [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/) template, with few new tricks. The gacha is much more deeper, similar to Genshin Impact and the incentive towards collecting and upgrading multiple characters is also very strong. Not only they have elemental systems 🔥 but also synchronous Coop and other strong social features.   
  
Did I also mention that they run a 1 month iteration of the casual collectible album that you can find in Royal Match or Monopoly GO? It enables you to trade cards with your friends 🤩. This is the first midcore game I have seen running it. Because the whole game is much more core the country profile is also different than a usual Habby hit. 45% revenue from China, 24% from Japan and only 10% from US. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej](/in/matejlancaric/) 😎
