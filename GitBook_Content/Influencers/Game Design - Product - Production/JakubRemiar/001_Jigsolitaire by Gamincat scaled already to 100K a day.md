Jigsolitaire by Gamincat scaled already to $100K 🤑 a day in ad revenue.

Hey wait a second, but where is the Solitaire part??? 😲 Get the story here 😎 …

The answer is 𝐍𝐎𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐄!, only in the name and the theme. But as you see in the game, it is actually completely common Jigsaw puzzle, with level based progression and the typical ad based monetization of interstitials and banners. So why is it pushing so hard on a solitaire theme? The answer is simple. The whole Jigsaw puzzle category is pulling 2 Mil. downloads a month while the whole solitaire category is doing 32 Mil. a month !!! 😹 16x times more. So by Jigsolitiare doing currently 300K downloads a day and around 10 Mil. downloads a month, it is basically enlarging the whole jigsaw category by a lot 😅.  
  
Again we are here in the exact same theme as we were many times during this year, and that is that the UA rules everything currently, no matter the product that you have. The only thing that matters is how will you scale users on your product, not what the product is. As it is seen here, the setup of basically “Where is the solitaire?” “We lied” 😅 still works great in the current market. And this is not an exception but it is happening all the way up to 4X, Puzzle, Simulation, etc. As currently “This is the way” as Mandalorian said 😅.  
  
This is in the end very clever and it is similar to the success of Disney Solitaire by[Playtika](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playtika/), which took the other road and monetized the Solitaire traffic through heavy puzzle game monetization.
