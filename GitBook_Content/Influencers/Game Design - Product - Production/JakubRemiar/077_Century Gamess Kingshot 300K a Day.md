##### [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/)‘s Kingshot has already generated revenue exceeding $300K a day.

It is the second biggest game in their portfolio after Whiteout Survival (which is still making $4 Mil. a day 😱). How is it different?

The game starts with the proven Frozen City 🥶 Idle template, which was simplified as there is no temperature control. Instead, there is the occasional invasion of bandits attacking ⚔️ your city, which adds active gameplay similar to Archero. 30 minutes later, the watchtower building unlocks and walks you through the usual radar feature of the 4X map, and then 4X takes over, similar to Whiteout Survival. Also there is a Fishing minigame added in the style of Ridiculous fishing 🎣.   
  
This onboarding is much different than High Seas hero 🚢, their previous 4X game, which actually have 3 cores – starts with Legend of Mushroom and then Frozen City and then 4X. So it seem Century is returning to the tried and tested 2 cores setup, with their proven Idle onboarding. Probably 3 cores were too much? We will keep an eye on this to see which one scales higher. Talking about scaling, why do you think there is an Archero-style bandit invasion?   
  
You guessed it, because its their winning UA creative concept. Most of the creatives use this mix of Archero 🏹/ Rush Royale tower defense gameplay, which is then exactly translated into the game. During the invasions, your whole base and all the buildings are part of it. You even build defensive towers. So here we are once again at a point where UA creatives are perfectly synced with the product onboarding and even gameplay in order to reduce CPI. And it is definitely working as the game just now scaled to 150K downloads a day. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎
