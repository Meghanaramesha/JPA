Pixel Flow by [Loom Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/loomgames/) just breached through $300K a day 🤑 in revenue and is not stopping down with 150K downloads taking the sort sub-genre by storm. Get the latest here 😎 .

The game is actually an iteration on This is Blast! from[Voodoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voodoo.io/), which soft launched in February of this year and it is slowly scaling to $30K a day currently. Then comes October and Pixel Flow already scaled to 10x of that in 3 months 🚀 You can see in the images that the shooting mechanic stayed but the sorting was iterated much further, with the conveyor belt added around the picture, increasing the sorting area 4 times basically. This seems like a much more enjoyable experience.  
  
Of course as we are on the mobile games market, other studios hop on a winning train extremely fast, so we already have a follow up – Color Pixel Shooter by[Amobear Game Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amobear/)(from Vietnam, no surprise there 😁). Launched one month after Pixel Flow at the start of November and already doing $75K 💸 a day and nearly the same amount of daily downloads, actually if we look at US only downloads they are doing more, 50K a day to be precise.  
  
The puzzle genre market is getting extremely competitive ⚔️ and it is no surprise that these 2 games are coming from the hottest places for puzzle in the market and that is Turkey and Vietnam. Actually next month, it seems Pixel Flow will the biggest game in the sort genre doing more than $7 Mil. a month, overtaking Magic Sort by[Grand Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grandgames/). Stay tuned as we will do a special episode on this soon on [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
