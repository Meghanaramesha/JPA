# Royal Kingdom: Match-3 Game uses 4X Creatives from Kingshot?

It is very obvious these days that the main genre, which really figured out scaling user acquisition to giant install volumes is 4X, mainly Century Games and River game.

Both companies use very similar strategies of fake ads- fake onboarding game – real game, in this bait and switch setup. So their ad creatives really work if you follow this execution.  
  
This essentially means that everyone is looking up what they are running and using the same. Even games totally outside midcore category, like Royal Kingdom, which runs this exact same creative extensively in their playable setup.  
  
What a time to be alive 🤣 when a casual game is running a midcore game creatives. The UA paradigm has totally changed and if you don’t catch this trend you will be pushed into the sidelines by the others, which are scaling these their games to giant volumes this way.  
  
And I even haven’t started about the state of creatives being watermarked now, because competing companies are literally just stealing them, cutting of the end cards and running them in their own user acquisition campaigns 😅.  
  
This is just a tip of the Iceberg of what we saw in the latest episode of October creative trends.
