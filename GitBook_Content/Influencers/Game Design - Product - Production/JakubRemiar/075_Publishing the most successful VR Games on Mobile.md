###### [Estoty](https://www.linkedin.com/company/estotygames/)‘s I am Cat and I am Security are currently making $300K a day 🤑 in ad revenue together with 500K downloads a day.

Is publishing the most successful VR game on mobile the best trick you’ve heard about? 😱

This is one of the most craziest stories that we covered this year, where literally the most viral VR game got ported on mobile, it spams interstitials like there is no tmrw 😵, has rewarded videos even for basic interaction (like you see in the piano image) still keeps its viral traffic and then … profit 💰 I am Cat has 62K reviews and 4.9 score on the [Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/) VR store, which is more than Beat Saber! (52K) The mobile version is already past 15 Mil. downloads in a little bit more than a month. I am security is already past 22 Mil.   
  
And the VR virality translated perfectly. Don’t believe me? go on [YouTube](https://www.linkedin.com/company/youtube/) and search “I am cat” and you will see zounds of shorts with 30+ Mil. views 👀. This combination is really deadly in the best possible meaning. And nearly all the videos are from its VR peak. We are seeing here the exact same trend that happened when the Supermarket manager went viral on Steam, and then it also went viral on mobile with multiple studios chasing after this trend. But doing it with a VR game? Who would have thought 😅   
  
This just proves that mobile game developers are chasing (those that know what to do 😅) mainly after proven hits/ gameplays/ trends that are already well-received within a big audience, and they just offer it to them on mobile. Looking closer at Steam and other platforms is now even more important as a mobile game developer than ever.
