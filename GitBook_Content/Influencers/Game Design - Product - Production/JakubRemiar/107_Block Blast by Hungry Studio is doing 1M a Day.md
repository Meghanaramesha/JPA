###### Block Blast by [Hungry Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hungrystudio2021/) is currently doing 🤑 $1 Mil. a day with around 1 Mil. downloads a day on 40 Mil. daily active users 😱. This is the biggest Ad revenue game on the planet right now. We got our review ready for you 😎…

There is of course the very close likeness to Tetris 🟦, that the game cleverly uses, but it definitely has its own iteration. Blocks are coming in trios at the bottom, and until you place all 3 you won’t get new ones. Blocks are destroyed by placing full 8 blocks both horizontally or vertically. You are given points based on your moves, which gives you your score. This creates a very satisfying blasting environment , with even callouts such as Perfect or Excellent, based on your placements.   
  
The secret of success is of course hidden in the background. It is obvious that the difficulty is being managed behind the scenes. The game gives you blocks that “surprisingly often” 😅 match your missing space precisely, making you feel very powerful as you clear screens of block endlessly. On top of the classic mode there is also a level based adventure mode, with goal objectives added. And most people don’t know, that there is even a 3rd core gameplay hidden 😱 in the setting menu, where you can play this “drop” version of Tetris, where you can move blocks just to the sides and new blocks are coming from the bottom, kind of like reverse Tetris.   
  
As mentioned, the game is completely Ad driven, there is not even a shop. It thrives on banners during the levels and interstitials between the levels. On top of this, you can also get a revive if you fail during a level or the classic mode. Progression is very shallow, there are some medal achievements and a streak counter, but that is pretty much it. It is incredible how so much revenue can be achieved with a very simple feature set, if it gets the proper level design and balancing treatment.
