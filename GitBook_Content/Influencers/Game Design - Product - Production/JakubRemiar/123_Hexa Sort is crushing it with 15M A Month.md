# Hexa Sort is crushing it with $15M A Month

###### Hexa Sort by [Lion Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lionstudioscc/) is really crushing it with around $15 Mil. a month 🤑 and around 3,5 Mil downloads a month. We had it on our radar for some time, but it seems it reached a record scale just this month, kudos to the team 😎 Why is it so successful?

The core gameplay is very unique, as it basically created its own sorting sub-genre in a very crowded segment. The core is deliberately design to have long level ⌛ times as users can hop in and out of the level at any point, no time or moves pressure. Only space on the board is the main fail state mechanic. If you can’t put additional hexes on the board that is full you lose 😵. The other important fact is that new hexes spawn only in trio, so you can plan only 3 moves ahead. This creates the great “one more move” feeling, which make the game so addictive.   
  
The visual meta progression of the game is taken from proven hits such as BlockJam 3D, another Hybrid puzzler in [Voodoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voodoo.io/)‘s portfolio, as well as the engagement mechanics such as the fast trigger events (image3). This setup now a standard among all major hybrid puzzlers 🧩. What makes Hexa stand out is its core, which is perfectly adapted to the app open interstitials that happen during long level times. Regarding the level mechanics additions, it is somehow light, but it follows modified version of the typical casual puzzle level design, which works well.   
  
We have already seen this core being adapted into a puzzle RPG (Hex Heroes) so in the end we could be looking at a fresh new puzzle subgenre. Big casual players are probably already experimenting with it, so its a matter of time until we see “Hexa Crush”, “Hexa Scapes” or “Royal Hex” 😅. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) 😎 .
