###### [FunPlus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/funplus/)‘s DC: Dark Legion scaled to $300K a day revenue 🤑

Pulling in $10 M during its first month from the initial release. Will it be enough to make a dent in the 4X genre 🤔?

This is a very ambitious iteration of multiple games stitched together. We have the idle part, which is basically Frozen City 🥶, but it uses the Fallout Shelter visual. Afterwards the game ads AFK Journey style squad RPG, with its heavy Gacha mechanics. The single player content is done through on rails mechanic of your characters going through a predefined map with events and encounters like Capybara GO. And then lastly it also ads the 4X layer, such as the map radar feature, where you can attack patrols of other player and a world map.   
  
This is where the formula start to heavily differ from the usual new gen 4X that we see on the market. Instead of using the other games mainly for the onboarding they are the core focus, with the 4X part being very limited. There are no soldiers to create, there is no hospital capacity, no time based currencies to use in upgrades. The worst part is that there is not really a world map as in standard 4X 😱. It is just simplified region control as seen on the right image. You engage with it only during a PvP event ⚔️ and only battle for specific nodes during that time. Therefore, there aren’t the usual dynamics, such as clans grouping together into nests, going into war against each other, loosing ton of soldiers in the process and conquering monsters on the map.   
  
I am afraid that by simplifying the 4X layer so much, essentially cutting spend depth out of it, this won’t be able to compete in the current market. We already see decline in active DAU and revenue, which resembles the curve of [Tencent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tencentglobal/)‘s Age of Empires Mobile. Another Big IP put on a 4X game that is just declining from its October release. DC:DL will still do a lot of money, but it just won’t scale higher. It a stark comparison to the new 4X games done by both [Rivergame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/) & [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/), which are all scaling steadily since launch. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎
