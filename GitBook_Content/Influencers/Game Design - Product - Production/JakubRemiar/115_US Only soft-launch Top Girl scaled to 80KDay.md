# US Only soft-launch: Top Girl scaled to $80K/Day

###### Top Girl by A3 Games (ehm, [tap4fun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tap4fun/) 😅) scaled to $80K a day in US only a soft-launch release. Is the Japanese Idol Master genre finally coming to the West? NO NOT, it is again another, ehm, …, read the rest here 😅

The game starts as Idol Master, and you as CEO manage a company of girls that produce music 🎵, have different abilities to increase the sales of the music itself and it is all nicely wrapped around the Idle generation mechanic, where dollars per second is the main progression of the game. Girls are given through gacha, there is a tour mechanic, which gates the upgrades, and the idle timer mechanic as you sell the new songs. And EVERYTHING is done with AI – the characters, the videos, the creatives, the “animations” 😱 .   
  
So what’s next? Welcome to a 4X map. Everything from now on is basically an Idol master-themed 4X. You go “slay” concerts and stadiums instead of enemies. You have fans instead of soldiers. and instead of mining ore and wood, you gather gold at hotels 😅. Some mechanics were really simplified, that’s why I really thought this would not be a 4X in the onboarding. There are no timed currencies, no 5-minute time items, no hospitals, no soldier-producing buildings. Actually, this is one of the biggest innovations here, that the 4X experience is heavily simplified, which really gives this a chance to actually work, as players won’t even notice they are playing a 4X 😅.   
  
Again, we tried to cover something different this time, but as usual, it was a 4X 😁. Great job on masking the genre in this new onboarding funnel. These simplifications can make the 4X gameplay much more accessible, either with this “theme” or some other CPI-lowering setup 😅. We will definitely keep an eye on how this game will continue in the future. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) 😎.
