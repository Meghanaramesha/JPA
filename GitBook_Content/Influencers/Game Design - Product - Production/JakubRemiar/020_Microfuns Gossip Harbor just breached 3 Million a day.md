[Microfun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microfun/)‘s Gossip Harbor just breached $3 Mil. daily revenue 🤑 and its wiping the floor with the merge2 category by doing more than $70 Mil. for last month. What is happening in this giant puzzle subgenre? 🤯

This whole category is actually pretty new compared to its bigger older sister Match3, which just did $300 Mil. for September last month. But its starting point was already $100 Mil. a month in March 2017. Merge2 on mobile didn’t even exist by that time. But it scaled from $10 Mil. a month in July 2022 to $100 Mil. a month for September 2025. So in around 3 years it 10x 😱 its genre revenue scale. Monthly downloads doubled from 6 to 12 Mil. a month. On the other hand Match3 was quite stable but actually declined a little bit from 15 to 12 Mil. monthly downloads.   
  
Microfun in the meantime nearly completely cornered the market as it now has the #1, #3 and even #7 game in the charts based on revenue and Gossip Harbor just keeps on scaling volume on both revenue and downloads, currently doing 150K installs a day. Its amazing how fast they scaled their new game Flambé: Merge & Cook, which started this May and it is already at $200K a day. As you see in the picture bellow, all of the games in their portfolio have similar core gameplay, so its just the differences in Meta, which differentiate them. They already have another game in Soft Launch – Icy Hearts, which is quite ironic based on their evergreen “freezing families” ad creatives 🥶.   
  
For comparison Travel Town, the category #2 is doing stable revenue of $700K a day but with just 1/3 of a scale of 60K downloads. So it seems the new challenger will be the unexpected entrant from a 4X company [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/) (You have seen the Kingshot ads already 🤣) with their game Tasty Travels, which already scaled past $350K a day, using their signature UA product funnel trick. They added the Fruit Merge gameplay into the game and, you guessed it, nearly all of their ad creatives are based on this concept. We are carefully watching how the Merge2 UA war will evolve on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
