# $2B Later, Umamusume Pretty Derby Launches Globally!

After more than 4 years and nearly $2 Billion in revenue Umamusume Pretty Derby is finally launching in the west on this week’s Thursday (26th) 😁 🐎 .

It has one of the most unique Rogue lite core gameplays out there, where you have to strategize which training activities you will spend your energy between the races of your horse girl and then you just watch the races 🏇, which makes the core fully automated. When the season ends you start with another racer, retaining some bonuses of your previous run. It has been already picked up once by [Small Giant Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/small-giant-games/) in the west, with the name of Charge Champions, but was killed in soft launch.  
  
Of course because its a gacha game, the game was doing massive revenue during its launch in 2021, having a baseline of $2,5 Mil. a day with massive spikes up to $6 Mil. a day 🤑. Of course only in Japan as 94% of revenue was coming from there and then 4% from South Korea. As I have seen multiple teams trying to follow this very unique formula but no one was successful yet, I still think that there will be eventually a proper western adaptation similarly how Empires & Puzzles was to Puzzle & Dragons. In Japan the IP is a big franchise with multiple seasons of its own anime and multiple anime spinoffs as sports anime are really popular there.   
  
Surprisingly there will be also a simultaneous Steam release, which could do even better than mobile versions. Even though I really like the game design system of this concept I am very conservative regarding its success in the west as I think it will be mostly hardcore english speaking fans, but let’s see 😅. You can guess that both [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) can’t wait to finally put some horse girls on a race track 🤣 as we will review the game on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast soon 😎.
