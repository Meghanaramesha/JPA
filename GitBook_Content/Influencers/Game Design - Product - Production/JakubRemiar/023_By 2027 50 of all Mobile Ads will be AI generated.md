Localizing your ad creatives? Just a simple change in the prompt 😎 Here we have an example from Kingshot, the biggest mobile game of this year doing 🤑 $3 Mil. a day in revenue !!!

The AI usage in mobile games ad creatives is getting so big, we had to start a special segment of creative trends focused just on AI 🤖. My prediction is that by the end of 2026, 50% of all mobile ads will be AI generated or will have AI hooks in them at least.   
  
So what 𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐬 we see this month in the market?   
▪️ Point of View ads (POV) with thematic narrative  
▪️ Pixelated art style transitions  
▪️ Pixar like animated character hooks  
▪️ Generated real life people hooks  
▪️ Split picture of UGC people commenting on AI creatives  
▪️ Split picture of AI people commenting on the real creatives  
▪️ Day 1 vs Day 1350 comparison, with some celebrity infringement 😅   
▪️ Cutting metal, planets and eating lava rocks   
▪️ This game has No Ads “humor” story  
▪️ God hand interacting with real life  
▪️ Street interviews   
▪️ Morphing 2 characters into 1  
  
AI hooks 🎣 are still much more prevalent compared to whole AI generated creatives. But the key UA spend is still based on normal “human made” creatives, they are still not going anywhere 😁. We still don’t see the usage of current top AI video models, as there seems to be a 2-3 months lag, during which creative teams hop on the latest tech. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) on this new segment on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
