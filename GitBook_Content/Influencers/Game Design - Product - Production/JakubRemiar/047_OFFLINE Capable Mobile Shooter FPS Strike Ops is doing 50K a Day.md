FPS Strike Ops is doing $50K 🤑 revenue a day on 250K downloads a day with a fully OFFLINE capable mobile shooter 😅 What is happening here?

If you look at the store screenshots, the game looks like Call of Duty 🪖, but if you actually play it you will see that it is basically a watered down version of counterstrike. You can play a lot of different modes such as boss mode, survival mode or the usual deathmatch. The twist is that this game can be played fully offline, which basically means that there are no players against you, it’s all bots 😮.   
  
This cuts down 50% of shooter genre problems such as matchmaking, stable CCU, difficulty etc. Wait, a shooter without actual PvP? Yes, this works because the game is focused only on low paying countries, 40% of downloads comes from India. There is not much player expectation here and the game needs to literally run on a potato 🥔 phone. But because it is offline it has snowballed it’s Daily active users to 5 Million 😮. So this is where the $50K ad revenue comes from.  
  
We have seen the power of offline mobile games before, and if you look at the company portfolio this is not the first time they have done this setup. It seems that sacrificing the always online functionality can have its benefits if you don’t plan to scale in high paying countries.
