As seen generating pixar-like high production consistent characters or gameplay like video is here to stay 😁 what else we saw?

𝐀𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐬 also work pretty well, in many different realistic, nonrealistic and bizarre formats. Candy Crush 🍬 is literally running an AI ad with generated bear that is calmed down by the game.

𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 still dominate the AI outputs, especially with eye catching satisfying visuals, which perfectly fits games like gold and goblins.

On the other hand we see an interesting dynamic in Century Games portfolio, where their biggest 4X games, Kingshot and Whiteout Survival are running mainly their bread and butter human made ads, while their new merge2 game Tasty Travels is mostly scaling on AI creatives. Already making more than $400K 🤑 a day.

As seen on their creative in the first image from left, you can’t even tell that it is done by AI anymore, only if you watch for the very obvious challenges, which AI still struggles with.

But the 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 that resembles the Pixar-like characters, which are consistent between the scenes.
