Review Radar #8 📡 is back with 15 games that we already covered on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast in last 3 months, as we keep them on our “radar” 😅. Get the latest status updates from big names such as [RiverGame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/), [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/), [tap4fun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tap4fun/), [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/), [Dream Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamgames/), [KRAFTON Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/krafton-inc/), [Grand Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grandgames/), [Hungry Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hungrystudio2021/), [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/), [King](https://www.linkedin.com/company/king/) 😎.

So the winner’s 🏆 bracket -Triple match continues to scale on amazingly high revenue 🤑 per download, with its new casual approach to hidden object. Dark War Survival is scaling up as expected of Rivergame’s new 4X games. Royal Kingdom is going bananas after one of the biggest celebrity campaigns in mobile gaming 👀. Block Blast is still hitting new record heights with its download volumes, 31,4 Mil. for the last 30 days 😱. Both Goods Puzzle, Blossom Sort and Magic Sort are all keeping their positions stable in the Sort genre. Color Block jam doing around 14 Mil. just in IAP continues to dominate Hybridcasual.   
  
On the “stable bracket” 📊 – Top Girl, now called Apex Girl finally stabilized. Archero 2 is in decline after launch, but my guess is that it will stabilize soon. High Seas Hero finally added the full 4X map, very curious to see if they still pull this off. Dark and Darker is finally in soft launch on mobile, but not much else can be said. Path of Exile 2 is still struggling with being able to run 2 games simultaneously, probably will stay in early access until end of next year. Candy Crush 🍬 Solitaire is not moving anywhere, yet.
