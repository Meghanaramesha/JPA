# Behind Archero 2

###### Archero implemented literally the whole core gameplay of Bacon’s Revenge as an event 😅.

We got to the point, where established games are literally absorbing new concepts as means to not only add flavor to their old feature set, but also keep their current players within their ecosystem, where they can offer the same novelty as competition.

The event is called Backpack Battle and its origin can be traced back to PC hit Backpack Hero, which all these inventory weapon management ⚔️ mechanics are trying to iterate. Bacon’s Revenge itself is a combination of Doodle Magic, which streamlined the tower defense genre by ditching a road and Backpack Hero, where you need to collect and merge weapons as your skills in a roguelite fashion.  
  
Why keep this within Archero 1 and not built a separate competitor game? Because Archero still makes more than $100K a day, with minimum downloads. It was released in 2019 and during the start of 2021 it got on a stable path of $3 Mil. a month in IAP’s only 🤑. NEVER went under this number to this day. Now you know why. It also seems that this concept is not performing well on mobile looking on competitor games performance, but that doesn’t need to bother them. They just rotate the event out if needed and build a new one if some other interesting concept in their genre comes up 😅.
