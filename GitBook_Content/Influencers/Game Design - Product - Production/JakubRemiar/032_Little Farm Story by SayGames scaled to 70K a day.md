Little Farm Story 👩‍🌾 by [SayGames](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saygames/) has already scaled to $70K 🤑 a day, and it will soon become the biggest game in context of IAP revenue in their portfolio. What is this game about? 😁

Its actually a great combination of DreamDale and My Perfect Hotel, the 2 previous SayGames hits. We have both the farming loop where you need to get resources and the automate it and also the building, selling to customers loop 🛒, as you need to manage the flow of those resources. More importantly, if you look at the overall art and execution, this game is basically modeled after the famous Playrix resouce style ad creatives, which most probably really helps with the CPI 😅.   
  
There are some very interesting iterations such as the whole area being covered with high grass that you need to clear first or other harvesting mechanics, which are actually very close to another similar game called Idle Breaker 🪓. There seems to be also much more progression layers, as you not only have the upgrade tree but also an inventory with a pretty deep Gacha system, which is probably the culprit for increasing IAP revenue. But there is also one pretty big twist 😮.   
  
Quests, tasks or other assignments all require different resources, which you need to gather or harvest, but the kicker is that every time you are near the source of these you can just watch an ad to get them instantly skipping the whole gameplay. And on top of this you can even do this with Experience points! Which means, that you can just watch ads and level up 🤯. This seems a little bit drastic to my taste, but let’s see if the game continues to scale as it deeper that you would think.

Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
