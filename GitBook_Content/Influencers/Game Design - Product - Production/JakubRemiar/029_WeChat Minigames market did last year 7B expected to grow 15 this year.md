WeChat Minigames market did last year $7 Bil. 🤑 and it is expected to grow 15% this year 💹. With 500 Mil. users this market is no longer a novelty, but a must watch for any product person. Get the latest here 😎:

There are 3 main genres to watch out 👀:   
  
◾ 𝐇𝐲𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐝  
Accesibility + Strategy depth. Hybrid Midcore RPG, mostly tower defense and Idle RPG. This category is contracting 📉 generally due to a lack of innovation and the decline of previously leading titles.  
  
◾ 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞  
Ported from mobile games 📱, adapted to mini game market, less grinding, more social. They are leaders in retaining paying users, demonstrating their ability to create deep, long-term value for their most committed players. They offer the highest LTV Growth, though they require longer payback periods.   
  
◾ 𝐂𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥  
Accessible gameplay, appeal to broad audience especially female/non-gamers. Its growth is driven by Merge/Match, this category’s share has grown significantly, reaching over 6% in the latest quarter.   
  
  
𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐫, the tower defense hit, is still the #1 game on the platform, with its metagame progression template being the most popular choice for other games on the platform. The developer itself is now trying to expand with it into 4X genre 😲. There are also 3 new games being tested from Habby, using also their new version of their metagame template.
