Unravel Master by EO game ([Supersonic from Unity](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supersonic-studios/)) scaled past $50K a day 🤑 in overall revenue. Get the latest on this unique puzzler with a big twist on the streak mechanic 😲

Made $5M+ since launch!

There is a very vibrant battle ⚔️ in the non-mainstream puzzle category especially in the block, sort and physics sub-genre, with the last being the category here. The game is about you slowly unraveling layers and layers of wool from objects into the yarn boxes 🧶. We have the pressure point done through the bench mechanic, as at some point colors of the surface layers won’t be the same as the boxes and you need to fish for the ones you are looking for, filling the bench as you guess under which layer the color you are looking for could be hiding 🕵.  
  
And then comes the streak mechanic, which is an X-ray ability, letting you see like a wall hack through the layers under their surface color. This is a core mechanic in some of the games in the genre such as Screwdom and fundamentally changes the difficulty balancing, as suddenly its more strategic. The team at Supersonic iterated on this and actually “monetizes” this ability through the streak pressure, as if you break your streak, you lose this ability, which makes the game much more harder. Great iteration that complements specifically this core gameplay 💡.
