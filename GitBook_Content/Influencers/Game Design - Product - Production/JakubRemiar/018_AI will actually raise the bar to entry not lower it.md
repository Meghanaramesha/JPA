# AI will actually raise the bar to entry not lower it.

It’s already harder to master than our game industry expertise of Art, GD, UA & Prog.

***Here is why:***

Everybody is either hyping AI to be the next messiah in game development or carefully waiting on the sidelines to see what will happen, not even reading about the latest tech. This is the wrong approach.   
  
The real issue with all of this, is that most western AI tools are completely closed black boxes ◼️. In China AI models are mostly open source and community driven. This gives the teams unheard levels of customization for their actual needs and possibilities to solve their own problems while being nearly completely free! That’s why they are so far ahead at this.  
  
No western 3rd party AI platform will ever give you the amount of control you will really need to create and fine tune your own custom LoRAs, model checkpoints and generation settings required to actually create high quality production assets with the mythical “AI production boost”.  
  
AI will eventually create an even worse environment ☠️, where you just won’t be able to compete with the speed of the teams using it properly if you don’t use it.   
  
Go download some open source models and generate some prompts to see how hard it actually is to make something usable.   
  
Get your hands on the real control with free tools like ComfyUI and see for your self how deep the🐇 hole goes.   
  
Learn the terms, concepts and tooling, so you won’t be completely left behind in the not so distant future. Worst case you will just clearly see through the hype 🤣 (Spoiler – it is still pretty over hyped 😅).
