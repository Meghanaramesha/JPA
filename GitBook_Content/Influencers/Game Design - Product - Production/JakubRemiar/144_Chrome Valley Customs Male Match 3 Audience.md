# Chrome Valley Customs: Male Match 3 Audience

Chrome Valley Customs by [Space Ape Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/space-ape-games/) is one year old and still dominates the male Match 3 audience. Already behind $35 Mil. 🤑 and 14 Mil. downloads, we are joined by Dmitry Gubanenkov to live review the game 😎.  
  
The core gameplay is a match3 puzzle, but the metagame is a story-based restoration of vintage cars 🚗. And this fantasy is executed perfectly. During onboarding you are restoring 🛠️ cars much more time than playing match3.  
  
Usually, match3 games have a 70% female audience. This game however has a 70% male audience proving an underserved niche. Truck Star from Century Games is already following this same use case with the Trucks theme 🚛.  
  
🦩 Matej Lancaric also talks about UA strategy, where the game used rapper Xzibit from the TV show 📺 Pimp My Ride to integrate into the creatives successfully. Thanks, Dmitry for coming on the pod and sharing many insights 😁. Join us as we talk about all of this and much more 😎.
