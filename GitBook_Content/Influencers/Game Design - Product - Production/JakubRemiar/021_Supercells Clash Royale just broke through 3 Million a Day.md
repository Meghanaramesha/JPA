[Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/)‘s Clash Royale just broke through $3 Mil. daily revenue 🤑 It now completely overshadows Brawl Stars. A new update again changed the card distribution system. What is happening?

Lucky Drops were removed and instead there are Lucky chests 🧰 now and 4 kind of them. Common, Magic, Haunted and Phantom. What does this mean in practical terms? As you may have seen my post from August, where I explained that basically Clash Royale did massive nerfs to their F2P progression, giving players less resources for free. This trend continues with these changes, getting those 5 star drops with possibility of dropping full evolution cards is now not really gonna happen, unless you open 5000 chests to break through the 0,02% chance 😅.  
  
It took Brawl stars 9 months to peak, during its “going to the Moon 🌑” phase, when it more than 10Xed the revenue from $8 mil. a month to $90 Mil. and from that points its declining for last 16 months. Clash Royale is already on month 8 of the “to the Moon” phase and it is still going up as it went from $14 Mil. a month to $75 Mil. a month for September last month. It is currently doing 55% of whole Supercell portfolio revenue on monthly basis.   
  
On the other hand it also needs to be said that Clash Royale is currently doing more than half a million downloads a day 😱 and is still scaling up the volume, with around 100K of those being from US, which are definitely not cheap to get. Even though Supercell relies mostly on their army of influencers, conventional UA seems to be also running full throttle here. Brawl Stars on the other hand never achieved those downloads numbers and briefly peaked at 400K during its peak in May 2024.
