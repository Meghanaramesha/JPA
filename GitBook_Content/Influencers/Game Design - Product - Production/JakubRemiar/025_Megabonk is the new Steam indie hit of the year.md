# Megabonk is the new Steam indie hit of the year!

Megabonk is the new Steam indie hit of the year, already past 85K 👀 concurrent users and still going up, with $2,5 Mil. 🤑 revenue in less than 2 weeks. What is this unique game about?  
  
On the surface it can look just like another Vampire Survivors 🧛 follow up, but it is much more. It uses some of the Vampire’s skill randomizer elements, but there are no evolutions. On the other hand, it adds Risk of Rain 2 into the mix with its items, map objectives and boss systems. This really unique combination and the movement in 3D space creates a perfect mix of innovation and fun.  
  
It is currently one of the most watched games on Twitch 📺, as Shroud found it and never stopped playing it since. The other big difference here, is that the RPG systems in the game scale so much that the builds streamers are doing look really ridiculous on max level characters. So it is very enjoyable to watch already and on top of this, as it is a rogue-lite, your character can die ☠️ any moment loosing it all, adding extra tension for viewers.  
  
The developer behind the game is a mystery as “vedinad” is backwards spelled danidev, which implies one the the biggest game dev YouTubers, but there is no proof 😅. This game works so well mainly because of its game design, which is gonna get immediately cloned on mobile. Join us as we talk about all of this with Felix & Matej!
