###### Goods Puzzle by [FALCON GAME STUDIO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/falcon-game-studio/) already scaled past $300K a day 🤑 with around 200K downloads a day. It is another recent hit from a studio in Vietnam, where gaming ecosystem is booming 📈. How did they do it?

This is a sort game, where you need to match 3 same items on a supermarket 🛒 bench for them to disappear. Compared to other sort games you can freely move items around the shelves disregarding their type when placing them beside each other, which is the opposite of the usual sort core, where only the same colors/items can be placed near each other. This is then smartly scaled through level design mechanics such as moving conveyor belts, chained shelves, and vending shelves, which creates difficulty through time pressure ⏲️ as you fail only if you don’t have any more place to move items or run out of time.   
  
Even though this concept was there before, the game team was able to come on top, even beating games like Goods Master 🛍️, which had a 1-year head start. You can immediately see that the team applied the standard puzzle genre formula by using the Royal Match 👑 meta + the collectible album mechanic. This just works so well for level based puzzlers of all kinds and it is compatible with any type of core gameplay, as long as you have levels with fail states. But don’t get me wrong, it is still hard to pull off 😅.   
  
As this is a Hybrid-Casual game, making around $200K from Ads and the other $100K from IAPs 💰, I am guessing that the CPI is definitely affected by the latest supermarket manager trend we talked about a lot before. This effectively enables the game to do 200K downloads a day. If you compare it to Magic Sort, the other sort game, which is doing similar $100K a day in IAPs, they are running on 20K downloads a day which is 10x less 😅 Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & Matej 🦩 😎.
