###### Magic Sort by [Grand Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grandgames/) continues to scale to $120K per day 🤑 doubling its daily revenue from the last time we looked at it in January episode.

It is currently the #1 sort genre game by IAP revenue, even taking over Hexa Sort by [Lion Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lionstudioscc/) (Hexa still makes a lot of ad revenue on top of this, of course 😅)

I would have guessed that there would be some major feature added in the meantime in Magic Sort, but it seems the team is just rigorously updating the game with more and more levels, which just shows how level design and content frequency is the backbone of this genre 🛠️. But I am still guessing that we will see elements from Royal Match, such as the event metagame and collectible album, being added in the next few months.   
  
Looking at the genre, it is mostly populated by Hybrids, making a lot of ad revenue on top of their IAP revenue. Magic Sort is the IAP exception, but it is currently being chased by other similar low-downloads heavy IAP games currently. Namely, Knot Busters 3D, which is an iteration on Twisted Tangle and a new scaling game from CrazyLabs, Coffee Mania, which takes “lego elements” 😅 from the big hit Color Block Jam by Rollic (currently making $400K a day 😱). This blocky core gameplay is killing it, so why not combine it with a sorting mechanic of coffee cups? ☕ Lastly, [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/) also has a horse in the race, with Crowd Express, using the traffic jam, bus mechanic 🚌.  
  
We will be watching the sort category very closely on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast, as its a place of great innovation in the casual puzzler category 🧩.
