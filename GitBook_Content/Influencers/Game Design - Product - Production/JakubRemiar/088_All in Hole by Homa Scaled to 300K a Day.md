# All in Hole by Homa Scaled to $300K a Day

###### All in Hole by [Homa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homa-games/) scaled to $300K a day 🤑, which is 6x its revenue since we last did an episode on it in November.

In the other corner of the ring Hole.io by Voodoo took notes, and it is currently doing 500K downloads a day 😲. Who is going to win the battle ⚔️ for this innovative core gameplay?

All in Hole changed the original [Hole.io](http://Hole.io) gameplay to level-based progression with Royal Match style events metagame, turning the game into an IAP driven monster 🤩. There are boosters, level fail states, teams, battle pass, and some ads. We can see again here that Royal Match events metagame just works so well for literally any core gameplay that is done in a setup of a based puzzler. This is now a must-have feature set when doing these. I would guess it’s the biggest money maker in Homa’s whole portfolio currently 📈.  
  
In the meantime, Hole.io went through a massive rework of metagame (there wasn’t any, really 😅) and also iteration on core gameplay, as it is now also done on level based setup. There is an upgrade system, events system, expeditions, and arena mode, with its very intriguing area occupation mechanic against other players. Currently, the download volume is close to its launch month (800K a day). We will definitely pick this up on our 2.5 Gamers podcast for a separate review mainly to see how new ad placements are implemented, such as the halftime placement, which basically forces an ad during core gameplay! 📺.   
  
So here we have a perfect example of the same core gameplay 🕳️ being used in a successfully scaling IAP-driven game and Ad monetization driven game, both scaling during the same period of time. I was expecting Hole.io core gameplay to return back as a Hybrid, but it seems it has risen like a phoenix from the ashes, doing massive IAP and Ad revenue like it’s 2018 again 😅, and it is the biggest download per day game in wthe hole VooDoo portfolio.
