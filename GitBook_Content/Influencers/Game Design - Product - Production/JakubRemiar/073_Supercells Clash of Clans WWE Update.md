###### [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/)‘s Clash of Clans just had a massive update this week, not only because the [WWE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-wrestling-entertainment/) (World Wrestling Entertainment) collaboration event ClashMania, but also doing some radical changes, so what happened 🕵?

All training timers ⏲️ for troops, heroes healing, spells, siege machines were removed from the game. This is a continuation of the removal of unit costs in 2022, which already created a much more strategic experience with out the worry of spending resources. Similarly during the economy revamp during the introduction of the battle pass in 2019, this again accelerated the content progression speed of the game, which now has townhall 🏛️ 17 as max level. It started with max level 8 during its initial release during August 2012. You can see how Supercell is continuously adjusting the game according to the current content length in order to stay fresh and balanced.   
  
The Friend or Foe WWE themed event ads on top of this philosophy. Adding multiple temporarily units from the wrestling universe to completely change the current army meta builds keeping the experience fresh again. By attacking enemy bases you can collect event tickets to unlock these troops. They will sit in the army camp building, which if attacked ⚔️ there is a chance that they can either attack you or join your troops against the enemy base. And yeah, as you see on the image K.A.N.E. is pretty OP 😁  
  
Clash of Clans continues its very stable performance still doing around $35-40 Mil. a month for the last 8 years, especially thanks to these excellent updates. All together the lifetime revenue of the game is over 7,3 Billion 🤑 which means that it is responsible for 50% of Supercell’s overall lifetime revenue. It was nearly always the biggest game in the portfolio except Clash Royale’s initial years until it was overtaken last year by Brawl Star’s giant ride to the moon 🌚. My prediction is that in the long run it will again return to the top of the portfolio, outlasting pretty much everything else 😁.
