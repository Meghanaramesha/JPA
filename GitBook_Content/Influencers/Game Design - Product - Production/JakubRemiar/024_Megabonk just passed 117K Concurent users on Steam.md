Megabonk just passed 117K Concurent users on Steam 🤩 and is still scaling up. That’s around 40% more from last week 👀 I just can’t get enough of this game and want to talk about how it improved one of the biggest pain points of the genre 💡.

In rogue-lite games based on Vampire Survivors 🧛, you have the skill randomizer during the run, which determines which skills you will be using in your limited skill slots. Once the slots are full you just select the upgrades as no new skill can be selected. And here is the issue, as in the beginning its really critical to “be lucky” 🍀 and get the right ones, otherwise you are forced to take bad skills. Megabonk gives the player drastically more control over their build selection as the player progresses through the metagame unlocks.  
  
In the shop there are 3 unlockable upgrades of Skip, Refresh and Banish giving you a choice of refreshing a roll of random skill during level up, skipping it all together it you don’t want to select anything and even removing selected skill forever from you current run. And each has 6 upgrades giving you each option 6 times 😲. Especially later in progression, when much more skills are unlocked, which means it is much more harder to roll what you want from a bigger pool, this system greatly improves the frustration from not getting what you want and scales really well with new content 📈.  
  
And not only that, there is also a special item that can literally “toogle” between having and not having the skills and items you have unlocked during the run, giving you even more control. This is not just a viral hit trending because of some coincidence. This just proves that in order to be successful you don’t need giant budgets 💰 and flashy production, but great game design being able to create deep systems = fun, in the first place 😎.
