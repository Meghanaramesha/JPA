#### Soft-launch Sonar #8 📡 is back with 12 brand new soft-launched games with no particular filter.

There are games from a lot of big players in the market such as [Metacore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metacoregames/), [Supercent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercent.io/), [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/), [Homa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homa-games/), [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/), [Spyke Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spyke-games/), [tap4fun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tap4fun/), [MY.GAMES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mygames/). Come check out what we caught this time 😎.

[Metacore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metacoregames/) is continuing the innovation in the merge genre, with level based merge boards, now with the 2nd game. New shots in the Match3 battlefield with [MY.GAMES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mygames/) “Wizard” based game and [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/)‘s farming game. They are really pushing hard into casual, this is the 8th or 9th game as we lost count now 😅. On the other and [Spyke Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spyke-games/) is again surfing the trend, trying to do an IAP driven Block Blast game.   
  
[Homa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homa-games/) is iterating on [Tripledot Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tripledot-studios/)‘s Nut Sort. [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) announced a new “Boat game” 🚢, seems like a streamlined Sea of Thieves. [Supercent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercent.io/) is combining Dreamdale with Alien Invasion into an arcade idle RPG. In their main studio,111%, they are doing a roguelike RPG with Monopoly GO board, pixel-themed visualization. HypeHype Inc. is building a game of their own on their UGC platform in the style of Alien Invasion.   
  
In another part of “Keeping up with the 4X” 😁 we see another onboarding iteration from tap4fun, where the Top Girl game girls were repurposed into the older Kiss of War game, now called Throne of Roses. If they worked in Top Girl, why not try to squeeze the CPI on the real deal? 😅 On the other hand,Shop & Goblins has a very unique “appraising” loop, in the theme of Pawn Stars TV show, a really unique idea. And lastly, Joynet games finally released English localization for their top WeChat game, now called Go Go Samkok, can’t wait to play it. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎 [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/)conferencing in the meantime ✈️.
