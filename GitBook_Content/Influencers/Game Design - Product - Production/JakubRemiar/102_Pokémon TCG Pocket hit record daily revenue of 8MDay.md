###### Pokémon TCG Pocket recently hit record daily revenue of $8 Mil a day! 🤑 and finally introduced Trading 💱 and it is, how to put it, “complicated” 😅. We all knew this was coming, but we really didn’t expect this execution. Read the latest on all you need to know on one of the biggest new games on the market 😎.

Every Gacha (lootbox = random rewards game) is based on the premise that everything you get goes through random chance. You can’t chose what you get and there are very small chances to get the best content, because the game pretty much ends when you get it, which will never happen as they will add more “new best content” later 😅 Trading or any sort of mechanics that is directly skipping through the randomness is completely breaking this system. Imagine playing poker, where you can trade cards with players from the other table. Yes, this is the level of broken we are talking here 🃏.   
  
Therefore in order to preserve the game economy, this feature is so watered down by so much friction and limitations that it got turned into a nice to have “new player booster”, where new players can catch up to old a little bit faster. Cards from the latest set can’t be traded at all 🛑 together with cosmetic cards with the highest rarity. So you can only trade old set cards and in order to trade them you need trading energy + trade tokens. How do you get trade tokens? You burn 🔥 your current cards. TLDR to trade 1 EX card, the ones you really need, you must burn 4 other EX cards worth of tokens from your collection. And to top it off, you can only trade with your friends and you can’t even communicate with them through the game which card you want, you just need to go outside of the game and find them somehow 😅.  
  
But this still didn’t stop the game from making the giant revenue spike 💸, as it introduced the second card expansion. Just in last 7 days the game did $45 Mil. revenue alone, ending on a $5 Mil a day baseline for now. All together in less than 4 months from its launch it already crossed $350 Mil. 😱 and 63 Mil. Downloads. 38% of the revenue is coming from Japan and 25% from the US. As always downloads are flipped, where Japan did 5 Mil. and US 10 Mil. You can’t beat Pikachu at his home turf in Japan 😎.
