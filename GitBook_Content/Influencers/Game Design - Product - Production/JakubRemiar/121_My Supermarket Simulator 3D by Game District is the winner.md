###### My Supermarket Simulator 3D by [Game District](https://www.linkedin.com/company/game-district/) is the winner 🏆 of the Supermarket mobile race with 20 Mil. downloads for last month still doing around 600K 😱 downloads and $50K revenue a day. Why did it won?

Out of all the supermarket games 🛒 (as this whole trend is based on a successful PC game on Steam) it has the most polish, most smooth tutorial and even ads some of its own on top of the original concept. Hard work did really payed off here 💪. We covered the first big mobile port in May and despite launching only in July, the Game District team was able to come on top.   
  
There is much clearer meta progression with goods 🛍️ ordered into milestone unlocks through license categories and even an automation of gameplay as you can hire your own cashier. But there is still a lot of manual work such as restocking the shelves and reordering the racks of your ever expanding supermarket. Heck, there is even an extra storage room you can buy. On top of this the city and the whole vibe is much more lively, you really feel the sunny weather 🌞 and there are even arcade games across the street with a functional basketball field. A lot of polish and small details really makes this stand out between the other 20 clones 😵 on the store.   
  
But don’t get me wrong, monetization is done very well 🤑, there are constant banners in the top right corner of the screen, together with never ending interstitials that are played disregarding of your current position of in the game – basically during core gameplay as there is no outside one. Energy system ⚡ also works pretty well for this format as seen on the slowly increasing IAP revenue. Join us as we talk about all of this with [[Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA27RCYBolGlkJ9FxuKw5RfgtXCEXzxqslA) & [[Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArnpK8BJQauPullIeKCtAxunX451Gme5_I), as he uncovers the hidden mistake that could increase the revenue by 20% 🤑.
