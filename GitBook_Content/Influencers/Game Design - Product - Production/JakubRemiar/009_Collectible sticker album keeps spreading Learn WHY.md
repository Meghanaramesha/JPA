☢️ Warning heavy knowledge podcast ahead ☢️ Collectible sticker album continues to spread, learn why 😎..

I have put together a timeline 🗓️ of games that added it into their feature set in last two years since the launch of Monopoly Go, which heavily popularized it. You can see basically the top of the top from the casual genre there and it is still going strong as [Playrix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playrix-entertainment/) added it last month 😁.  
  
Why is it so popular? Because it ads depth into very shallow economies, which desperately need it, but they can’t add more complexity because of their audience. So this ads a gacha system (sticker packs 😜) and a time based rotation event, which in the end doesn’t add any new permanent currencies into the game.  
  
The most interesting trend here is that this mechanic is starting to gain traction in midcore genre. Whiteout Survival added it in a streamlined form, Acecraft added it as core feature and Huntopia had it as a live ops event. I can’t wait to find it in the next [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/) game 😅. Join me on this special episode where I go deep on how this all works.
