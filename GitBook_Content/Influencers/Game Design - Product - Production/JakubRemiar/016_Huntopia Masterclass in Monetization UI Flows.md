# Huntopia: Masterclass in Monetization UI Flows

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Huntopia-scaled-to-100k-a-Day-in-first-month-1.jpg)

Already scaled to $100K a day in the first month!

This game is a master class in monetization UI flows, read why 😎

This is a 3D idle RPG, don’t get confused, even though there is 3D movement or the illusion of some 3D world it’s much closer to AFK Arena. You upgrade your hero, equipment, pets and the rest of 20+ progression layers 🫠. As you see there are more than 50+ UI icons in the main menu as they literally have every single feature in the genre and more. One of the key iterations is that they always upsell in every feature 💸.   
  
You want to claim idle rewards? Pop up on VIP to double them before opening them. You are claiming a battle pass? It always claims the premium column with an upsell button. You run out of daily dungeon runs, you can “improve” it if you buy a VIP subscription. These are not new but their implementation is so perfect that I am using this game as my go to template from now 😅. Btw 60% US revenue 👀.   
  
As you see on the 3rd image, this is the second midcore game where I see a modified shorter iteration of the casual collectible album we know from Monopoly GO. Less cards, but same setup, you can trade, recycle, get rewards, etc.
