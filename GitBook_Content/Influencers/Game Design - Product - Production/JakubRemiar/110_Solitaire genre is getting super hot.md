###### The Solitaire genre is gonna get super hot 🔥 this year 😁. There are 4 high profile games already in the soft launch phase. Who is gonna win this race?

The Solitaire category is currently completely dominated by [Playtika](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playtika/)‘s Solitaire Grand Harvest making $15 Mil. a month. So who are the challengers?   
  
[King](https://www.linkedin.com/company/king/)‘s Candy Crush Solitaire has been in soft launch for a long time bringing the big IP with him. [Metacore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metacoregames/) is getting out of their merge comfort zone bringing their Grandma into the genre. [Wooga](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wooga/) is using their perfected metagame from June’s journey, swapping the hidden object core for solitaire. And lastly [SuperPlay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/superplay/) is applying their winning metagame formula from Domino dreams, where they already conquered that genre, to solitaire with a Disney IP.  
  
What is the kicker here? The last two games studios are actually owned by [Playtika](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playtika/) itself 😅. So it’s actually 3 games against 2 in favour of Playtika.

Who do you think will prevail here as a genre leader by revenue? 🤔
