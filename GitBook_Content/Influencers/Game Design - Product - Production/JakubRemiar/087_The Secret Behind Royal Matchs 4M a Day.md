###### Warning ☢️ Heavy Game Design post ahead 😁

[Royal Match’s](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dreamgames.royalmatch&hl=en) 👑 event metagame system has become not only the golden standard for level based games, but its a must have driver for monetization 💸. All the top casual games use it such as Monopoly GO, Match Factory, All in Hole, HexaSort, etc. Why it is so exceptional?

The beauty of this system is that it is not dependent on core gameplay. Usually, it needs just a level-based setup, but even Monopoly GO, which isn’t level-based, uses it in an iterated form 🛠️. The main purpose of the system is to put incentives and time pressure towards playing the main core gameplay. This increases engagement time as surely you won’t go away now if there are just 10 minutes ⏳ left in the event. It also reinforces playing the core and building your habit, which translates into proper session count metrics.   
  
The pressure element is the key vector. We have seen win streaks getting implemented across the board, even in Squad Buster in order to drive usage of consumables to prevent loosing the streak. What this system does is the same principle but on steroids 💪. You are not only losing a win streak but whole events you have worked whole day for 😅. The other important factor is that these events are very short, literally from 1 hour to 18 to 36 hours. Because of this, they need to be triggered individually by player progress. Forget the events calendar; this machine operates exactly on your every level start event and optimizes towards your player behavior.   
  
The last piece is the competitive element 🤼, as this heavily uses player leaderboards of every kind. Your ranking within your team, within a group of random players, a duel against 1 player, and of course, your team against other teams. Everything is put on a rewards-based ladder to again put pressure on playing the main core as much as possible during a limited time period. To spice it up, some events have an active element such as unhiding a puzzle, firing a pinball machine, or other random chance elements, so the flavor is different. Royal matchmaking $4 Mil. a day 🤑 is the best sales pitch for this system.
