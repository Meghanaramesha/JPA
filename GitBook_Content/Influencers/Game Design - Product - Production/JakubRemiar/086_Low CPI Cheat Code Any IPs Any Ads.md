# Low CPI Cheat Code: Any IPs, Any Ads

###### IP infringement taken to a new level ⚠️

Why bother with licensing if you just gender swap all of the top anime IP characters into oversexualized women?

The mobile game [Enigma of Sépia](https://enigmaofsepia.com/) released last month did just that and already made $3M, still doing $80K a day 😅

I have seen a lot of blatant Pokémon and Anime rip-offs lately, probably because of the renewed success of Pokémon IP that TCG Pocket brought, but this one really is on top of it all. Even though the art is low cost they took great effort into putting all of this IP into “this state,” and there is a lot of it. I found even Blizzard Entertainment’s Genji from Overwatch there, who I couldn’t even show here on LinkedIn for obvious reasons. 😅 How long can this thing exist on the store Google, Apple? It’s been a month already, and no, this is not an Asian market; 60% of the revenue is from the US.   
  
The best part is the marketing, especially the creatives, where they directly name all those characters and their respective IPs, which is the key narrative of the ads! “We have all your favorite anime characters, but we turned them into women. The joke’s on you! 😜” The game itself is nothing special, just your usual gacha-based idle RPG ⚔️ with waifus. Based on its extremely robust feature set, I am guessing that it happily lives somewhere in China, and the devs just said, Why should we not also release it to the West? Hold my beer 🍺.   
  
I am just hopping I am not looking on another evolution of the “lowering CPI at all cost” movement, which is currently raging with the fake ads turned into fake minigame onboarding – Go all in with all the IPs you want, market it all the way, make money until you get eventually banned 🤔.
