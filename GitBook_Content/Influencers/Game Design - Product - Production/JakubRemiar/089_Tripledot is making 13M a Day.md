# Tripledot is making $1.3M a Day!

[Tripledot Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tripledot-studios/) is making around 1,3 million a day 🤑 in ad revenue within its portfolio, and it is the secret buyer 😲 of [AppLovin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/applovin/) gaming business, as we learned last week 💡.

Why is the company so successful, and how big are they?

As said, the key lies in ad revenue 💸, which is a little bit hard to spot with our usual industry tools, but as we have Felix on the team, the problem is solved 😎.  
The game that did put the company on the map is Woodoku, which is an ultra-casual Tetris like puzzler, which even though does currently just low, 30K daily downloads, still has a monster 1,3 Mil. DAU, with US playerbase being 15% of that. That’s where the money is made 💰. Looking at last months downloads, there are already new rising stars in the portfolio that can continue this success.   
  
Match Crossword is currently scaling by 150K downloads a day and the studio already has a direct answer to Hungry Studio’s Block Blast, and that is Woodoku Blast, which is aggressively scaling from the start of this month by 130K downloads a day. To top it off, there is also Nut Sort and Blossom Match doing both 70K downloads a day. All in all the whole portfolio is bringing around 600K downloads a day, which tells you how much UA and Admon firepower the team has 🔥.  
  
We can’t also miss the fact that Tripledot acquired ZephyrMobile in 2024, a direct competitor focused on the same kind of games, which just fortified the studio’s arsenal. We know that in 2023, Tripledot did $340 million in revenue, but I would guess 2024 was around $400M. So buying Applovin’s games surely isn’t a problem for the team, and I think it can help them a lot to diversify the portfolio into more heavy IAP-driven games. We can’t wait to see what will happen next. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.
