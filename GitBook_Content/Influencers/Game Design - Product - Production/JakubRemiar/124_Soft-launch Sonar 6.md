Soft-launch Sonar #6 📡 is back with 15 brand new soft launched games with no particular filter 😅. There are games from a lot of big players in the market such as [MY.GAMES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mygames/), [tap4fun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tap4fun/), [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/), [Wooga](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wooga/), [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/), [Lion Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lionstudioscc/), [Supercent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercent.io/), [Kwalee](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kwalee/), [CrazyLabs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/crazylabs/) & [Estoty Riga LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/estoty-llc/). Come check out what we caught this time 😎.   
  
[MY.GAMES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mygames/) continues some bold iterations with a combat version of Hexasort – Hex Heroes. This is done in the same manner as Empires & Puzzles took match3 gameplay and put it into a puzzle 🧩 RPG combat. Also, there is an iteration on Clash Quest – Castle Duels with merging elements and Bounty Buddies, which is taking notes from Rumble Heroes. Looks very similar to the newest [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) soft-launched title R.I.S.E, just single-player.  
  
[Wooga](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wooga/) is stepping again out of its comfort zone trying its meta with a Solitaire core. This is a hot battleground 🔥 as Candy Crush also has a solitaire title in soft launch. [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/) is returning in big style by global launching Capybara GO today! and already having Archero 2 in soft launch. (Can’t wait to do special episodes on these 😁) Estoty continues its Idle Breaker iteration with a 4th theme now, the Harry Potter lookalike 🤩 as [Kwalee](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kwalee/) joins this race with their own iteration on the survival breaker genre.   
  
The 4X war also rages on ⚔, as we see Tap4fun soft launching not 1 but 2 games based on its hit Age of Apes🐒. Both Monkey Control and Monkey Clash are testing different variants of onboarding gameplay with the same 4X core as usual. [Supercent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercent.io/) is finally iterating the Supermarket genre with a fast food spin 🍔 and [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/) takes the Cup Heroes core and combines it with Timeline up. Join us as we talk about all of these and more with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & Matej 🦩 😎
