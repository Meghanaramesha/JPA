###### Project R.I.S.E. by [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) had its 3rd Alpha test last weekend and we couldn’t miss it 😎. This time also on Android, the dev team finally showed us some Metagame features and iterated a lot on the previous feature set. Get the latest update on this cooperative roguelite ARPG ⚔️ here:

Tower upgrades 🗼 were introduced, which are powering the feature unlock progression. You still get pass points for chests, but recycling the perks points (basically discarding skills during your run) gives you a permanent upgrade to your account through these. These include stuff such as more consumable slots for revives, more perk rerolls, feature unlocks etc.   
  
Another Metagame feature added is Tower Forge 🔨 (bottom Image). This basically unlocks the skill pool of core gameplay skills on semi-random pacing as you sink soft currency into it and a random skill of 8 gets unlocked. Eventually, you unlock all and move to another tier with 8 more skills again. These get progressively stronger with higher rarities and effects. Overall, the game UI also saw a nice overhaul and you can now ask bots 🤖 to join you if matchmaking gets too long.   
  
I think this is great direction, but we were expecting a little bit heavier 🏗️ feature set in the game already with Matej 🦩. I predicted that there would be one more test in Q1 for this game before it goes into softlaunch, but it seems there still will be one more before that happens. Let’s see where this goes, as we are nearing the same situation where 2 quite similar games are again in soft launch on Supercell portfolio, the other being Moco. This already happened with Squadbusters and Floodrush. No [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) this time as he was playing other games for Ads in Barcelona 😁.
