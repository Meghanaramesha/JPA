# Royal Match by Dream Games makes $4,5 million a day!

Royal Match 👑 by [Dream Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamgames/) is doing $4,5 Mil. 🤑 a day in revenue, and started testing the new Multiplier Token mechanic. This could be a new monetization feature, but players seem divided. Read the latest here 😎:

Currently, there is already a double rewards per level mechanic, as seen on the first image on the left, but its time ⏲️ based. You can’t control it, which means it has time pressure, but also you can’t buy it, which will be the key iteration here. So they added a Multiplier Token into a test instead, which can be obtained through events, but also bought. It gives you the same double level rewards as the current timer version, but you consume 1 token per level played instead of a fixed time period. This means you can log off and get double rewards later or refill for soft currency to have more of it, essentially giving players a way to double their events progression speed.   
  
As mentioned, this seems to be a test, where some players have it unlocked and some players don’t. Or they don’t have the tokens yet 😅. Reactions are also divided as some players like the option to not be rushed by the double reward timer and have flexible play time, but veteran players already see it as a downgrade 😭 as they could complete more levels during the timer, which is not constrained to per level basis of the consumable tokens.  
  
From economy standpoint, this seems like a great addition, as it could add another significant currency sink, and a new consumable currency into an already very shallow economy to begin with. Because Royal Match has such a robust events feature set, they are able to afford spender players to go at x2 speed on these pretty much all the time if they keep buying the tokens 💰.
