###### [Rivergame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/)‘s portfolio is crossing 🤑 $7 million revenue a day this month!

This Chinese Mobile games company, specializing in 4X titles is killing it. Not only do they have the #1 grossing game in the genre, but also top 4, top 6, top 11 & top 12 🤯 spots. How did they do it?

2 key tactics – templatization & marketing strategy. Each of their games is using their own signature 4X template, which they are perfecting after launching Top War in 2019. Similar to Habby’s (Archero) setup. Each game they create, they just reuse the work in their next game as the template grows more robust, it doesn’t matter if the current game fails. Since launching Last War in 2023 they scaled 3 more games in less than 2 years 😱! As you see nearly 30% of daily revenue is done by these new games, which is extremely healthy. If you don’t follow this production strategy, you probably won’t survive the coming years ☠️.  
  
2nd tactic – Marketing. They were one of the first ones to create an onboarding minigame based on the ad creatives they were using. Top War started as a merge game and then moved into 4X. Last War has a shooter runner with math gates, Dark War has an idle simulation (Frozen City), Top Heroes has Rumble Heroes ARPG and Last Z has Top Girl style dating 😅. Every time, they just repurpose their onboarding in sync with the latest trending games & creatives, keep the 4X part, and bam, a new game is printing money 📈.   
  
We have covered all of their games on the two & a half gamers podcast and we will release the review of their latest scaling game, Last Z this Thursday so stay tuned, it’s gonna be extra spicy 🌶️ 😎.
