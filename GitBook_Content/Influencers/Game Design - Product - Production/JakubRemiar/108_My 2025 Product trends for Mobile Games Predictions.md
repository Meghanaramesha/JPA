###### Here are my 2025 Product trends for Mobile Games predictions 😎 you can watch/listen to the whole episode on our channel 😁 or read the TLDR bellow 😅

🔷 Adapting proven Steam games into Mobile  
Last year we saw great success of the Supermarket 🛒 simulator games adapted by [Game District](https://www.linkedin.com/company/game-district/) and many others and this trend will continue. Another example is the adaptation of the Backpack Hero mechanic. 50/50 there is gonna be a mobile version of Helldivers 2. F2P version of Balatro is a done deal for sure (The mobile premium version makes $100K a day 🤑). I guess 5 teams are on this already. Palword-like monster fighting and collection mechanics are already seen in China. It will be probably Q2 when they hit the western mobile market.   
  
🔷 Casual Genres Disruption  
Because the traditional puzzle match 3 🧩 market is basically impenetrable to newcomers, smart developers are looking into more greener genres, which are ripe for disruption through a puzzle-like gameplay twists. Namely Solitaire, Sort and Hidden object. All these genres didn’t really innovate in last years but this is changing now. We already seen this with Domino Dreams, which took the traditional Domino market (The game just uses domino mechanics but on a puzzle like level basis). With Solitaire ♠️ there are already 5 big games like this in Softlaunch and Sort is being pummeled by the newcomers Hexasort and Magic Sort. Hidden object is going through a much more casual iteration combining match-pair mechanics with games such as Triple Match City and Find the Cat 😸.  
  
🔷 Fake Creatives + Minigames proliferation  
What happens in 4X drives pretty much the whole UA creatives market. This is already translated into Puzzle genre, because on big scale UA there is just no other way how play this game. All of the big Match3 games are using a similar version of this UA trick of having playable version of creatives in their level funnel. We already see this proliferating into other casual genres such as Sort and Hidden object, where a lot of these games just have a second core, because it is their UA creatives basically, so they try to offset the “fakeness” of the UA this way. 4X is continuing this iteration and we have already seen a game having 3 core gameplays in itself 😱 (which we will cover soon 😁)   
  
🔷 Templatization  
We again seen [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/) very successfully upgrade their template that they are using from 2019 with Legend of Mushroom elements ending with both Capybara GO and Archero 2 doing more than $1 Mil. a day currently 🤑. There is just no way to catch up to the speed of someone using a metagame template. Also seen in the [miHoYo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mihoyo/) Genshin, Honkai, Zzz example. This is gonna be a new normal that you will need to follow or you will be left behind.
