###### Warning ☢️ Heavy Game Design post ahead 😁

How does PvP counterplay systems work? We already talked about the elemental system driving PvE games, but how about Player versus Player games?

Again, similar to the elemental system, PvP counterplay systems can go from pretty straightforward (rock-paper-scissors ✂️) to some very advanced mechanics as faction and unit synergies, specific traits, direct immunity mechanics, and environment advantages. This system is powering some of the most biggest games on the market, such as Riot Games’s League of Legends or Supercell’s Clash Royale & Brawl Stars. Again, it is the hidden reason why you need to be able to master and, most importantly, collect or upgrade all or most of the characters in the game to stay competitive 😎.   
  
This takes much more skill than just playing with elemental affinities and throwing water dungeons at your player’s fire Pokémon. Designers need to closely follow the current PvP metagame and be able to actively change it by adding units that counter the current meta, so that the player base starts using them and the proven strategy from the previous update becomes obsolete. This learning part of figuring out the new strategy is the “fun” part in these games. Usually, these dynamics are accompanied by community outrage over nerfs and buffs, but again, it’s up to you 😱 to convince them that you are doing everything you can in the best interest of the game.  
  
A lot of the time, developers don’t really adhere to this, and there are the usual schemes, such as releasing a new unit, which is overpowered, then everybody buys it, and soon after, it gets reduced in power back to its place, and the cycle repeats. The other one being the “passing of the imbalance,” where there is always one overpowered character, but with each update, it is a different one. Ever heard of Rogues in World of Warcraft? 😅 The key again is to make sure that this process of rediscovery is enjoyable and fun, as even the mentioned multi-billion $ games aren’t perfect, but they are a hell of a fun 😁.
