# Monopoly Bingo! scaled to $100K a day!

Monopoly Bingo! by [Clipwire Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clipwire-games/) ([Tripledot Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tripledot-studios/)) scaled to $100K 🤑 a day, and its the 2nd best Monopoly license game after Mon. GO.

Read the full story here 😎:

The core gameplay of Bingo is extremely simple. There is a track of numbers being called out, which you must cross in your bingo card. Once you have enough for a bingo you call it and you win the card. To make it a little bit more interesting, there are special powerups, boosters and event currencies which occupy specific numbers on the board, which add a lot of progression into it. And also you can play 4 cards simultaneously 😵 literally like playing 4 poker tables. I am guessing seasoned players are all doing it this way. You need then to switch between 2 and 2 on a single screen so it gets quite fast 😅   
  
As mentioned, after the giant of Monopoly GO this is the second biggest mobile game with this license by revenue. After it comes slots 🎰, poker 🃏 and the actual board game. It feels to me like that there is still big opportunity here as the gap between this one and the Mon. GO is staggering. There is also the geolocation game Monopoly World currently in soft launch, which we need to see how it will work out, but I am still skeptical about it.   
  
Looking at the feature set of the Bingo game, there is also an actual monopoly board as a side mode, which you get meta progression rewards, mainly packs in the collectible card album, which is now in every casual game on the planet 🤣.

This is an interesting addition, and could also be a good template for other license monopoly games to include.
