# Grand Games just soft launched Block Star, attacking the Block genre!

[Grand Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grandgames/) just soft-launched Block Star ⭐ last week, attacking the Block genre 🟥, exactly as I predicted in a post here a month ago 😎 Why is this the most natural move considering their portfolio?

[As I wrote here before,](https://www.gamigion.com/grand-gamess-car-match-has-already-crossed-100k-a-day/) Grand is following a very efficient portfolio strategy, where each consecutive game is done faster than the previous one because the whole metagame is reused and upgraded by the previous game and they just add a new core gameplay that is compatible with a level based core loop 💡. This way they already have Magic Sort covering Sort, Car Match 🚗 covering Match Pair and now they have Block Star covering. And why specifically this genre? Because Block is dominated just by one big game, Block Blast by [Hungry Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hungrystudio2021/),  
  
With nearly 600 Mil. downloads and 40 Mil. daily active users 😱 and still doing nearly million downloads a day, this is a monster of a game. The other game I can’t exclude would be Color Block Jam by [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/), which is an IAP juggernaut making around $15 Mil. a month in revenue consistently, but its gameplay is much further away than the Tetris like block blasting of Block Blast, which is the one that Block Star is following. This means there is giant potential as Block Blast makes all revenue in ads and there is still no big IAP 💰 game in this sub-genre.  
  
Grand iterated the block blasting gameplay and added the typical match3 obstacle level design with a turn based fail state. This creates much more pressure than the usual fail state of Block Blast, where you are not constrained by time ⏲️ or turns and you fail if you run out of space on the board. On the other hand, we have [Spyke Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spyke-games/)‘s Cube Busters, which follows Block Blast much more closely, retaining its fail state, but also combining the typical puzzle based level design.

Who will be the one to conquer the In App Purchase charts of this genre first?
