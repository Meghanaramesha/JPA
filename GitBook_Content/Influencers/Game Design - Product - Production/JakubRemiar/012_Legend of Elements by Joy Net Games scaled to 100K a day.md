# Legend of Elements by Joy Net Games scaled to $100K a day!

This is the continuation of their other big Idle RPG – Legend of Mushroom. What is new? 😎

The game is now 3D but don’t get fooled, it’s only a nice visualization with no gameplay impact. Instead of the gear gacha making most of the UI like in LoM, here it is under one of the UI buttons together with many other progression layers. The side kick characters 🎎 are much more prominent here, with their own progressions and visualizations.  
  
During its peak Legend of Mushroom 🍄 did $60 Mil. a month, but has heavily declined since then to $4 Mil. a month currently. This is the starting point for this game. But I am quite sceptical about its scale in the west even though it is mainly powered by US revenue. It’s much more Asian themed and actually more core with less humor. Honestly, what can top fighting ⚔️ 2D mushrooms? 🤣   
  
As for UA it’s the typical Chinese signature mix of fake creatives that display 3 different games in one ad 🤣 which are all fake, of course.
