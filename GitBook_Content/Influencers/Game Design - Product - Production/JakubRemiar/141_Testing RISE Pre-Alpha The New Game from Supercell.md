###### We tested R.I.S.E. pre-alpha, the new game from [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/), which is the reboot of Clash Heroes.

You could play for 3 hours each day over the weekend and I must say we were positively surprised by the amount of innovation in the game 😁.  
  
Before playing the game I was concerned that another Action RPG on Supercell portfolio, where there is [Mo.co](http://mo.co/) already 🤔, would end up competing against each other, similarly to Squad Busters vs Flood Rush. But R.I.S.E. is a Coop Rogue-lite Action RPG with extraction elements! 😱 You heard it right. Let me pinpoint the biggest differentiators.  
  
Even though the build was very early production, you could see the idea they were going for. Players are matched before every floor (level) into 3 man parties consisting of 6 different heroes. During the gameplay as they clear the level ⚔ a Rogue-lite (choose from 3 abilities window) pops up – where they take turns, meaning the first player chooses and 1 more ability is added into the pool so others can also choose from the 2 old ones and 1 new one. (bottom image).  
  
At the end of the floor, players also choose which abilities they want to keep for the next floor (extracting them 😅 middle image) After this they are taken to the main menu, where they can choose a different hero and start the next higher floor, going into matchmaking with different players again. It is a very interesting pacing setup that I haven’t seen before and we can’t wait to see how the game evolves 😁.

Thanks again Supercell for inviting us to the pre-alpha. Join us as 🦩 Matej saves the day by playing on his iPhone and I trying to figure out what is happening on the screen 😅 no ads no [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) this time 😅.
