![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Key-Vietnamese-Mobile-Game-Publishers.jpg)

###### In the last 5 years we have seen more than 10 Bil. downloads 🤑 being done by companies that have risen in Vietnam Mobile gaming scene. It seems the ecosystem there is positioned for great future and a new hot spot 🔥 for mobile gaming. Who are the key players 😎?

Most of the revenue is coming from Ad monetization-based games that are in between the Ultra-casual to Hyper-casual to Hybrid-casual spectrum regarding their feature set. As for countries, this revenue 💸 is coming mainly from Tier2 and Tier3 countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Türkiye, Pakistan, etc. Even though some games have pretty high US download shares. It seems that they were able to find something 💎 that is no longer possible in the west, as most of the western companies are pivoting towards much heavier IAP monetization towards Hybrid-casual and Casual.   
  
To get a better understanding of the current status, let’s look only at the performance for the last 30 Days inthe context of downloads, so the chart will look like this 📊:   
▪️ 49 Mil. downloads – [ABI Game Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/abi-games-pte-ltd/)  
▪️ 48 Mil. downloads – [iKame Global](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ikame-global/)  
▪️ 35 Mil. downloads – [XGame Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/xgame-studio/)  
▪️ 34 Mil. downloads – [Bravestars Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bravestarsgames/)  
▪️ 15 Mil. downloads – [FALCON GAME STUDIO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/falcon-game-studio/) (Onesoft)  
▪️ 8 Mil. downloads – [Amanotes](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amanotes/)  
  
There are also studios that are pushing their IAP expertise, as you may have saw in our episode about Goods Puzzle by FALCON GAME STUDIO, which makes around $100K in IAP a day. I think it is a matter of time until we will see more casual and midcore ⚔️ games coming from this market, as this expertise will grow. Join us as we talk about all of these and more in this special episode with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.  
  
Disclaimer – It is really hard to track all of the accounts of Vietnam companies, therefore, I expect a margin of error around 500M downloads 😅.
