The competition in merge genre is heating up 🔥 as Tasty Travels by [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/) already scaled past $170k 🤑 revenue a day. Its the 6th biggest game by revenue in the merge2 genre coming from a 4X company? 😮

You read that right, Century Games, the masters of 4X, that we all know by watching that unmissable Kingshot ad these days (it is currently making $1,5 Mil a day!) was already heavily going after casual genre games. We already covered their match 3 attempts on the podcast with their Truck Star 🚚 success. But this time it is a merge game (and they did few already) that is actually scaling heavily in the charts and its currently their 3rd biggest portfolio game by daily revenue after Whiteout Survival ❄️ and Kingshot. Its a great move to diversify their portfolio into completely different genre and audience.  
  
Merge2 genre is dominated by the Chinese company [Microfun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microfun/) with the leading games Gossip Harbor and Seaside Escape. There is also Travel Town in second place owned [Moon Active](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moon-active/) and Merge Mansion on 4th by [Metacore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metacoregames/). We also shouldn’t forget Merge Cooking by [Happibits](https://www.linkedin.com/company/happibits/), which is also growing past $230K per day on the 5th spot. Microfun is also currently heavily scaling their new game Flambé: Merge & Cook, which already passed $90K a day. As you see the whole battle will most probably boil down to only one thing – User Acquisition 😁.   
  
Because Century are already masters of UA as they are coming from the 4X category, which everyone else comes to steal ad creative concepts from (hello Royal Match 👑) I can’t wait to see how these 2 Chinese companies will duke it out ⚔️ on the marketing front. I hope we will see some crazy new concepts and new AI hooks and AI based creatives instead of the usual freezing families, which is Microfun’s bread and butter concept for scaling games in this genre. We will definitely give you the latest regarding this on our [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
