###### Raid Rush by [Panteon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/panteon/) scaled already past $100K revenue a day IAP + ads and it is one of the most innovative tower defense games we covered, what’s new 🕵?

This whole game is a combination of very smart design, where most of the systems are actually taken from other games such as Clash Royale or Survivor io, but there is still key innovation to drastically differentiate the game from the other genre games. Here you actually build your road and select your towers 🏰 simultaneously through the 3 choice rogue lite randomizer. This creates a lot of strategic depth as you now need to make a choice between building the road or selecting tower upgrades. Building the road is also quite fleshed out as you need to also get more land, turns and plan curved sections to create choke points for the towers.   
  
Later more progression layers were added to complement all of this, such as heroes, items, active skills and now even an auto play button. The level structure is very long, which plays perfectly into sunken cost fallacy as you definitely don’t want to loose your progress on wave 39 out of 40 after nearly 30 minutes ⏲️. There is even an excellent IP promotion with the Terminator brand currently, integrated into the many live-ops events that the game has to offer. This is a great example of how clever design built upon the foundations of proven systems was able to differentiate itself and create its own market share, instead of doing another 300th clone of survivor io.  
  
As the game has a hyper casual visual feel during its levels, basically hordes of enemies coming at you, which is super popular ad creative concept these days, (wink wink Kingshot 👀) you can see why this also works on the UA side. There is also a varied use of AI hooks, which is always great to see the creative team is following the latest trends.
