Epic Plane Evolution by [Voodoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voodoo.io/) scaled past $170K 🤑 a day in both IAP & Ad revenue per day still doing 100K downloads a day. Is this the Hyper-casual comeback 😲 ?

The game started scaling last October doing around 100K dowloads a day and even though it declined 📈 during start of the year it still got back up again to the original 100K a day baseline, which is amazing considering its very shallow feature set. It is already past 25 Mil. downloads. In the past Hyper-casual games would fly up into the charts and then slowly die off, but here it seems the downloads pattern is different.   
  
The gameplay is very simple, where you slowly build up a plane (you literally start with just the middle part with out wings 😅) and then launch it with a slingshot. If you figure it out, you can maneuver the plane a little bit and hopefully, by buying more upgrades you will start to get further and further in the level, instead of just nonstop crashing immediately 💥. The progression is simple, you start with a cardboard plane, and then move on the semi – realistic timeline, eventually flying a commercial airliner, etc. The loop is completely the same each world, just different visuals and higher numbers on upgrades and speed.   
  
If you look at the initial screen, the 3 upgrades currently resemble the initial state of Mob Control, before it was converted to a fully midcore game. Could this go the same setup? The game is in the Arcade Driving category, which is driven a lot by organic downloads dominated by Hill Climb Racing 2. I think Voodoo being Voodoo, we are gonna see some changes moving the game feature set towards Hybrid-casual soon 😁.
