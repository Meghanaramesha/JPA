Knit Out by [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/) has already scaled past 🤑 $100k a day in revenue. It is another unique puzzler 🧵from Rollic’s signature template, which is on fire lately 😁.

You see from the middle image that they are again iterating the core gameplay with the bench mechanic (the 6 slots in the middle for yarns), which already worked so well for all the Bus 🚌 and Screw games. This adds an elegant fail state, where you can get stuck on a full bench. This is much less obvious than the usual moves or time mechanics, putting much softer pressure on the player.  
  
The bottom part of the core gameplay screen is basically reversed Block Jam 3D, which is another proven setup. And then we have the top part of the screen, which is the actual iteration + putting all of these together. It is a randomized conveyor belt of woolen 🦙 colors, which you need to put on the matching yarns. It is also very satisfying to watch 👀, which is of course used in the UA creatives. But, don’t get me wrong, the game is super hard 😅.   
  
This is not an isolated release, as if you keep following released games in Rollic’s portfolio, you can clearly see how they are constantly reusing the same successful mechanics in different flavours and contexts, which enables them to churn out these hits very fast as they already know the winning metrics they should aim for. Because all of these games have very similar level funnels.
