So the winner’s 🏆 bracket – Vita Mahjong scales to infinity and beyond, the ads are everywhere 😵 Match Villains are not slowing down. Last Z 4X waifus now do nearly $40 Mil. a month, but move away as Kingshot is reaching stratosphere with $71 Mil. a month and still going up 😱. Mobile game of the year 🥇? Matching Story continues to scale the double core formula of Match3+Merge5. Chess .com still scales up, even though they leave so much possible ad money on the table 😅 And short drama market is heating up as Drama Pops continues to scale up.  
  
On the “stable bracket” 📊 – Love & Deep space is just printing money, Screwdom is printing them in 3D 🤣. Surprisingly stable downloads on both I am Cat and I am Security. Dreamy Room stabilized together with Disney Solitaire, which is now the category leader. Both mo. co and DC Dark Legion are not moving anywhere it seems 😢.
