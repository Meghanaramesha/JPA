#### [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) global launched Moco last week.

Their Action RPG, that got out of its long periodic beta (since Oct. 2023). With around a week of data, there is $350K revenue and 2,5M downloads, which does not seem so super 😟. Let’s look deeper into the game 🕵.

This is as streamlined ARPG as it gets. You don’t collect weapons from the ground and compare them in your inventory, you don’t craft specific items, there are no skill trees, there are no gear sockets or enchants, there is not even the armor 🛡️ part of the inventory. You just choose 3 active and passive skills + weapon, which determines your playstyle, and that’s it. Later, you get 3 more stat-based elite rings. I think this streamlining process went a little bit too far, or as a veteran ARPG player, I am confused about the market audience for this game 🤔.   
  
Everything is given through a gacha system, which once drops a duplicate of an item you have, it automatically upgrades it, and not even soft currency for upgrading is involved. Basically the whole game is an RPG on rails regarding its itemization, which is breaking the main rule of ARPGs that they are only as good as their itemization system – the loot that we all kill those monsters for in the first place ⚔️ . Monetization-wise wise it’s very heavy on cosmetics, and you can’t buy power. There are just 2 season passes – base and elite ones, that will give you a little bit more gacha boxes, but that’s it. This is probably the reason, why there is so low revenue on so many downloads.   
  
The marketing campaign with the invite codes only was excellent, and Supercell’s creator army is flooding the net with their video content. But I am afraid that even with great marketing and amazing production values, churn will hit very fast, as in any other grindy ARPG, where it needs to be great itemization & endgame features that decide the success in this genre, and those are currently missing here. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.
