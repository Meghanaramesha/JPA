###### The mobile games “I am Cat” and “I am Security” are each doing 600K downloads a day 🙀 topping the download charts. The plot twist is that both are originally VR games 🕶️! Lets look deeper into this crazy story 🕵

You can find both games on Steam for premium price developed by [New Folder Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newfoldergames/). Actually I am Security was released on [Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/)‘s Quest store in June, 2024. Fast forward to today, both games are now published by [Estoty Vilnius](https://www.linkedin.com/company/estotyvilnius/) Feb 15th and Feb 23rd on mobile stores, and adapted for mobile gameplay, which is the key to this success. You have the full joystick control scheme with abilities and other adjustments, so it is pretty seamless. There are even ability buttons for watching ads 😅   
  
Both games are “life simulators”. I am Security is iteration on Paper’s please, where you are the bouncer of a night club and you need to check guest with various “items” 😅 coming in. There are simple rules to follow and you can modify their belongings and visual. Everything leads basically to funky situations and the game isn’t very serious. Same with I am Cat 😸, where you live the life of a cat with quest assignments around the house such as turning on the Cat TV channel on TV remote 📺.   
  
Both games are trying to keep you playing as much as possible with not only lot of ad placements in the environment but also interstitials being run pretty frequently. I am guessing that both games are making in the hundreds of thousands of ad revenue per day. Can’t wait once we do a proper review episode on this on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast with [[Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA27RCYBolGlkJ9FxuKw5RfgtXCEXzxqslA) & [[Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArnpK8BJQauPullIeKCtAxunX451Gme5_I) 😎.
