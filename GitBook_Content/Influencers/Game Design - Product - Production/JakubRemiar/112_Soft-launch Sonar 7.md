###### Soft-launch Sonar #7 📡 is back with 15 brand new soft launched games with no particular filter 😅. There are games from a lot of big players in the market such as [Metacore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metacoregames/), [Supercent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercent.io/), [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/), [Voodoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voodoo.io/), [Homa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/homa-games/), [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/), [FunPlus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/funplus/), [tap4fun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tap4fun/), Joynet Games. Come check out what we caught this time 😎.

[Metacore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/metacoregames/) is innovating the merge genre, with level-based merge boards and also entering the Solitaire race with their Grandpa 👵. It is gonna be a heated category where multiple big names such as King, Wooga, SuperPlay are gonna battle over it next year. On top of it, Rollic is also entering the merge genre with Barbie IP. Continuing the casual board games trend, Voodoo is gonna chase its “Domino Dreams” 😅 Also Hexa sort core is being iterated by Homa in a coin-style fashion.   
  
Century Games is continuing its casual “factory” with another puzzler and also one bold iteration of Legend of Mushroom + Fallout Shelter 😱. On the other hand, Joynet Games (Legend of Mushroom) is finally bringing its flagship WeChat minigames title, an Arcade Idle 4X to mobile.   
  
In another part of “Keeping up with the 4X” 😁 we can clearly see multiple onboarding iterations from top 4X players, that are changing only the early experience, and the rest of the games remains completely the same as previously tested titles. This time we have physics-based destruction of landmarks, mob control style tower war, barrel creative runner, and Hero wars number eating game. Join us as we talk about all of these and more with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) 😎.
