This week, it will be 1 year since the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket. The game just crossed $900 Mil. 🤑 in revenue and is currently going through major feature updates. How does it look?

The game went through 11 pack expansion during that time and added the “quite limited” trading functionality, but as for core features not much had really changed. No new big events systems or alternative game modes. And I understand that its is mainly about just collecting, but it could be so much more 😅 and this fatigue is also seen on the revenue. As the launch month was $150 Mil. compared to 6x less, around $30 Mil. in September. There is going to be the Mega evolutions update this Thursday, but I am skeptical as this is the typical “just more content” won’t save you situation.  
  
Having more than 36% of overall revenue from Japan, this is still not really that big of a global mainstream game. US doing 28% of overall revenue. Compared to something like Pokémon GO, which did $536 Mil. in last 12 months but with opposite countries share of 44% US and only less than 20% from Japan. I am still waiting for [Scopely](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scopely/)‘s acquisition to show its effect. It will actually get even more crowded for Pokémon IP games as there is the looming Pokémon Champions 🏟️ mobile game scheduled to release in 2026. Both mentioned games need to step up their “game” in order to offset the declines.  
  
As a player I am still “playing the game” every day, but really I am just opening 2 free packs 😅. After the latest expansion update that included reprinting of all the EX cards and the foil cards, which literally just recycled old cards and added a shiny glow onto them, it feels like they have reach the end of their content treadmill. I get that they need to inflate away some cards so they will create an entry point for new players, but the team should really focus on some new Metagame features that will offset the “more of the same” style they are currently running. We will be keeping an eye on this on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
