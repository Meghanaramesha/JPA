[Scopely](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scopely/)‘s Monopoly GO is currently running its Marvel collaboration and I was curious 🕵 how it actually used the IP game mechanics-wise. The event is running from Sep. 26th till Dec. 5th. so there is plenty of time to check it out.   
  
The main driver is of course the Marvel themed sticker album 📕, which is the core progression mechanic of the game that gets a season reset. The interesting part is that you get cosmetic rewards not only for completing the whole album but also for some specific sets such as the Wolverine token in the image. This makes it worthwhile even for someone not aiming to finish the whole album to get the Deadpool token. For example, you can get Iron Man shield skin for completing his set or Thor’s emoji.  
  
There will be also special Marvel-themed in-game events. The first one is the Avengers racers 🏎️ event, where the first 3 racer teams get not only a lot of sticker packs, but also Cpt. America shields skin with only the first place 🏆 racers getting a Hulk Bumper Token. This event already ended as it was running from Oct. 9th till yesterday. As hinted, there will be more different events with other various prizes.   
  
I am really interested in the social aspect execution of these, as here in the racer event you had to select 3 friends to be able to even compete in the event. Overall the collab is full of special cosmetic prizes such as tokens, skins, and emojis all in Marvel theme. In the end, this really helps the game as there are not enough permanent rewards in the game economy 📈.
