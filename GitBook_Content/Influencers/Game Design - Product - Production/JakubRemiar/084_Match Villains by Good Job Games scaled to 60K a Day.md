###### Match Villains by [Good Job Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/goodjobgames/) already scaled to $60K per day 🤑.

Last week they raised $23M from [Menlo Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/company/menlo-ventures/) & [Akin](/in/akinbabayigit/) (Arcadia Gaming Partners) so there is definitely potential and money for UA 😎

#### How is the game looking?

Even though the game was soft launched in last year’s April and started scaling at the start of this year, this is a veteran team founded in 2017. Despite starting as Hyper casual developer, it already scaled and sold Zen Match to [Moon Active](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moon-active/) (for something between $100-150 Mil. 💰). Zen Match has done $130 Mil. in IAP lifetime revenue. This is where the basis for IAP puzzler expertise was gained from and in Match Villains this 100+ team just perfected it.  
  
The game is going directly after match3 heavyweights such as [Dream Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamgames/)‘s Royal Match 👑. The production quality is on a similar level, but the game still lacks the robustness of the event metagame system, which I guess the team will catch up soon. Product then being on parity, the key will be again the marketability question. You may find the characters somewhat familiar? Because they are inspired by the animated hit Hotel Transylvania, the main character is literally just missing vampire teeth 🧛. The ads creative strategy is already following the “save the king” concepts.   
  
The big difference is that Royal Match has these “save the king” levels implemented on each 10th level. Match Villains has periodic “heist” levels, where you need to open the save and collect coins, which is a nice mechanic, but it won’t directly translate the creative concept as Royal Match’s version. I am guessing we will be soon saving a not-a-vampire someone from drowning in coins rather soon 😅.
