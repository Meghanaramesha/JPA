###### [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) ran the 2nd Beta test for Project R.I.S.E. during last weekend and there were some major changes 🤩 done to the core of the game from the 1st test, that we saw during July this year. Get the latest run down here 😎

The biggest change is the perk selection as it is going be asynchronous, meaning you don’t need to wait ⏳ for other players to choose and the game won’t stop during this time as in previous version. Each player now has their own pool to chose from, which is affected by their overall progression. Perks now cost elixir giving it a strategic choice, with the possibility to save it between floors. This is a great change as it removed a lot of friction and unlocked more metagame options to affect the perk pools 😁.  
  
Heroes got a new 6 tier progression with 18 levels that require Gold and Hero Badges. Leveling up your hero unlocks new Upgrade, Trait or Ultimate slots. There is a backpack 🎒 now for consumables, with 2 Phoenix Feathers (revives) being added onto each floor for whoever finds them. Also Floor Skips were added to again remove friction when restarting the floor progression. The stronger your hero is the more “higher checkpoints” you get. Finally a team up feature was added, so no more relying on random matchmaking only 😅.  
  
One other great quality of life change that was added is the new end of the floor setup. No need to wait for all of the players to get into the end area, as just one player will start the end timer⏲️ . It seems the team is removing a lot of friction and adding a lot of quality of life changes, definitely great direction currently. We will be watching 👀 closely what will happen next as we think there will be a 3rd beta test somewhere in February next year.
