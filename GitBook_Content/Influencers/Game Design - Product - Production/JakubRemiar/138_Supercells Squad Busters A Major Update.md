# Supercell’s Squad Busters: A Major Update

###### All of the consumables including MEGAs, 3 types of keys, and rerolls were removed from the game 😱

Baseline revenue of around $250K a day increased to $500K during the update. The DAU that was on the decline now finally stabilized at around 1,5 Million DAU and is slightly increasing. Here is a summary of what you need to know 😎:  
  
All of the consumables were considered “pay to win”, by the community as they gave players, who use them a really big competitive advantage over other players ⚔. All of the MEGAs were turned into actual character skins together with the introduction of new cosmetic-only currency-style tickets. The game now puts much more emphasis on cosmetics with the introduction of Super Rare skins 💎, which have their own emotes.  
  
The Lucky Find 🍀 comeback mechanic was iterated, now it gives a random fusion from your team instead of a MEGA unit, and can happen more often. This iteration is also a return to the standard roguelite feature set, as this gives the player a clear boost to finish his current build instead of getting a completely new character. In Survivor.io 🧟‍♂️, some chests drop from elite monsters, which exactly do this, an upgrade to a skill that the player has already acquired, in order to help him finish his build towards the end of the game. Rerolls now can be used 3 times per match by default.  
  
The other interesting iteration was done on the chest 🎁 multiplier mechanic, which was time-based and now can be turned on and turned off based on player choice. It gives 2x, 3x, and 4x multipliers on characters given through chests after the battles. I think this is just the first of multiple major changes that we will see down the line. I guess that the next change will concern different rewards for PvP wins making it more viable as a strategy towards win conditions and adding a more impactful metagame layer to improve the D30 retention of the game.
