###### Boat Game by [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) is currently in its second alpha and we finally did a proper review of this mysterious game 😎. Get the full picture here:

As for the genre this is a 3rd person twin stick action shooter 🔫 with naval combat. Even though imho the naval combat is non-existent, because go try to hit a speed boat with a looping cannonball 🤣. You go exploring around the islands, searching for chests, which you get by doing random encounter quests, and then you bring those chests in your 3 slot cargo hold of your boat into the main hub. After you open them you get better gear for you 4 slot inventory, Weapons, HP and boat gun. Rinse and repeat. Sounds pretty easy 😅   
  
The twist is the PvP mechanic. At any point you can “turn bad” 😈 and pretty much enter the player killer form. Now you can attack other players, steal their chests from their boats or do other mischief. Of course “good” players get incentives to kill you back with wanted rewards and other PvP dynamics. And on top of all this the environment, with its monsters that are also trying to kill you is still there. So its a Player versus Environment versus Player game (PvEvP) to be precise. The overall setup is actually similar to Squad Busters match, but here the world is much more open and there are no time limits.   
  
This game was first announced in February this year, when it had its first alpha. Now we are in November, 9 months later and we are in second alpha. I am guessing that with this pacing, we could see some proper soft-launch by the end of next year hopefully, but let’s see how it goes.
