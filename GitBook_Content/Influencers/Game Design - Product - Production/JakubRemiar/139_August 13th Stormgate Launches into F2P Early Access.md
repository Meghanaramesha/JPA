###### Stormgate from [Frost Giant Studios, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/frost-giant-studios/) launches into F2P early access next week on the 13th of August.

It is one of the last stands of the Real Time Strategy genre on PC 🖥. We got to talk with [Tim Morten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-morten/), Production Director & CEO, about its development, business model, and future roadmap 😎.  
  
The business model of Stormgate is similar to StarCraft’s 2 F2P transition in 2017. Players can play the competitive part of the game completely free (including custom maps! 😁) and they can buy more single-player & coop content such as additional heroes together with corresponding cosmetics with one-time purchases. Additionally, there will be much more content added from each category later this year.  
  
RTS was always the cradle of multiple other genres such as MOBA, Tower Defense, etc. which were all done in the map editor of these games and then played on custom player maps. Stormgate retains this legacy, once the map editor is finished, with very friendly creator terms. This user generated content could be one of the key drivers of this game besides the competitive RTS player base, as we have seen with the RTS games of the past. I guess that if this works out, this will be a very significant portion of the DAU as I remember my days on W3 [Battle.net](http://battle.net/) very fondly 😅.  
  
If you are a Warcraft/Starcraft player looking for something new that continues this legacy, this ex-[Blizzard](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blizzard-entertainment/) [Entertainment](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blizzard-entertainment/) team delivers 🤩! Thanks again [Tim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-morten/) for coming on the pod and sharing a lot of interesting background insights, it was an honor to have you with us 😊. Join us as we talk about all of these with even me, [Matej 🦩](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matejlancaric/) & Tim playing a coop map, while [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) tries to save the discussion 😅.
