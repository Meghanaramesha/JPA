ReelShort by [Crazy Maple Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/crazymaplestudio/) scaled to more than $1 Mil. a day 🤑 with around 200K downloads a day. Is it an App? Is it a game? It’s a money-printing machine 😅. This story is one of the craziest games we covered this year, redefining the whole interactive story genre to its base. Get the full rundown here 😎  
  
ReelShort “App” is in the Film & TV streaming category with contenders such as Disney+, [HBO](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hbo/) or [Netflix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/netflix/). By hiding its gaming nature it is much more approachable and mainstream. The overall UI as seen in the images really looks like a streaming app, but don’t be fooled 😵, beneath the polished exterior lies the tried and tested interactive story game, that has took its monetization to the next level. By the use of soft currency in interactive choices, clever ad placements, and even an incentivized cross-promo it has all of the staple features of an interactive story genre 📚.  
  
Games such as Choices by [Pixelberry Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pixelberry-studios/) or Episode by [Pocket Gems](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pocket-gems/) were the leaders of the interactive 2D story genre during its height around 2017-2019. But in the end, a 3rd game became the category leader at that time – Chapters, which is done by none else than [Crazy Maple Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/crazymaplestudio/) 🕵. You can see where this is going. The 2D stories are now done in fully fledged live-action movies with around 60-90 1-minute sequences on a budget of around $300K per 1 story 😱! You unlock them with ads, subscriptions, or soft currency, which is deducted automatically if you have enough 😅.  
  
ReelShort went already past $200 Mil. just from mobile (it has also a robust web) and 60+ Mil. downloads. Being able to affect a live-action movie with an interactive choice and on top of a paid one 😅 is something that other streaming platforms like [Netflix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/netflix/) should take note of as it definitely works. And just wait until you see their 20+ minute creatives that [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) showed 🤯 Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & 🦩 😎.
