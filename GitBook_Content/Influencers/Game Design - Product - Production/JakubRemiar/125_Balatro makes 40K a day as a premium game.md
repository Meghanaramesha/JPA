Balatro is currently doing $40K a day 🤑 on mobile as a premium game! as it launched there on Sep. 26th. Already past $1,8 Mil. in less than a month and 300K+ downloads. We couldn’t ignore this design masterpiece so here is the rundown 😎  
  
Originally published by [Playstack](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playstack/) & developed by Localthunk, Balatro was released on Feb. 20th on Steam as a premium game for $14.99. With more than 44K reviews and a 97% positive rating currently, it is one of this year’s big indie hits. In August PC Gamer reported that it already sold past 2 Mil. copies, which we can assume is then around $30 Mil. !!! 💰. Then it launched now on mobile for $9.99, in pretty much identical condition as the PC. Now it is literally #2 on mobile premium grossing charts, right behind Minecraft.   
  
The game is an amazing combination of poker and solitaire single-player deckbuilder. You play limited # of poker hands ♠️ each round to achieve the required points. Different abilities and joker cards help you with this as you can basically cheat your way to an ultimate deck just full of aces 🃏. Progression is similar to typical roguelikes, like Vampire Survivors, where with each achievement you unlock more abilities, decks, tarot cards, jokers, etc. Pretty much the whole content of the game.   
  
The re-playability of the game is its main strength, with literally an addictive nature of “one more run” after you lose. The content is paced perfectly making it more and more interesting as you unlock all the interesting combos and additional mechanics. This again proves the point that very strong game design is all you need for major success, no fancy quadruple A effects needed (at least on PC 😅). Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) and the missed ad opportunity of the century 😱.
