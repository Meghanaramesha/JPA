###### Dark War Survival by [Rivergame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/) already scaled to $300K a day 🤑 with 120K downloads a day. This is one of the craziest stories in 4X this year 😱 Get the latest here from the 4X war that rages on in the market at the top of the charts ⚔️.

This is the same team that did Last War Survival (Also Top War & Top Heroes). As you see in the screenshots, not even icons were changed 😅. The key iteration here is that the Last War team took their game and put a [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/)‘s Whiteout Survival (their biggest rival) onboarding onto it 😵. No more gate mechanics but a shelter like idler in the FTUE with a walking dead survival theme. There is an emotional story, there is the auto-combat minigame, even with Survivor. io style input and an offer to save a sick dog for $10 (which stays there forever if you don’t pay 😅). Afterwards the 4X takes over.   
  
This is the way, as the only thing that has been iterated here is the initial onboarding and some minor changes such as heroes leveling. The big question is of course if those 2 games will make more than just first one alone, but we will check that for you soon 😎. This is very strong trend where 4X companies don’t touch their main 4X engine at all, it gets completely recycled into each of their consecutive games. They iterate only the onboarding with different art styles, themes, minigames, combinations of all of these and of course UA creatives.   
  
Speaking about those, they are fully AI generated! Not only the creatives but also store screenshots and the icon 🤯, probably also some assets in the game. This is the first game where we really saw their power fully unleashed and it is working like a charm 😁. This is really the future of UA creatives. Thank you [Jani Torppa](/in/jani-torppa-80480a122/) for coming on the pod with us and sharing some fresh thoughts on the ASO, creatives strategy and sorry for putting [Geeklab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearegeeklab/) out of business by [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & me 😅.
