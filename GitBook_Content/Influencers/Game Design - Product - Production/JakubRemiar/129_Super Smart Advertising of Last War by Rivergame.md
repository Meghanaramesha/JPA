# Super Smart Advertising of Last War by Rivergame

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-244.jpg)

###### This is super smart advertising by [Rivergame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/)‘s Last War 😁.

By getting the actor Antony Starr, the marketing team cleverly created situations in the ads that heavily imply his major role (Homelander from The Boys series) even though, they probably don’t have the rights for the series 😅, just for the actor.

Despite not having the superhero costume, just by adding his signature laser eyes and his “unique” humor, you won’t even notice that this is not Homelander. It fits really naturally, no Batsuit or Spiderwebs are needed to instantly recognize your favorite “superhero” 😎.

Lately celebrity & IP crossover advertising in mobile gaming has seen an uptick, especially with the Squad Busters launch campaign, Royal Match Cameo usage, and now with the Monopoly GO Marvel in-game event. Maybe by the end of the year, we won’t have fake ads all over the place but instead, celebrities playing games from the fake ads in the fake ads 😅.
