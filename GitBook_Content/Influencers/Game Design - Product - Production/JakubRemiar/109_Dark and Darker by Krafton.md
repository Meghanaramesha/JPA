# Dark and Darker by Krafton

###### Dark and Darker mobile ⚔️ published by [[Krafton Inc.](/in/krafton-inc-a29889262/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAECOyoEBMT1YFezgEfq80Nchgo_1suH3f-w) is on its way to launch in the first half of 2025. We couldn’t wait, so we reviewed the PC version of the game and looked at the different monetization models that the mobile game will probably have.

The game got taken down from Steam and after a victory in lawsuit over Nexon’s copyright claim in January 2024 it is back on Steam from June 2024. The PC version relaunched as a free to play game with a very unique model, reminiscent of Path of Exile “pay for convenience”. As you see in the image, by being free to play you can only enter the Normal dungeons, have 1 character slot and can’t sell items on the marketplace. After a $30 purchase the game basically goes from demo mode into full paid version. Cosmetics can be purchased in the shop on top of this of course.   
  
The mobile version on the other hand will be 3rd person instead of 1st person. It will be much more brighter 💡, as the PC game is really dark, and its hard to even walk around the dungeons with out a torch 😅. By preregistering you will get a A-rank AI mercenary, which suggest that there will be a Gacha based rarity system and already a feature that is not available in the PC version. The other intriguing item listed on the pre-reg site is Safekeep tickets, which suggest that the game could be monetizing the fail state of the the extraction mechanic itself.   
  
As listed “Prevents you form losing items if you die” I think this will only cover items you bring by yourself, not the ones you loot. Nevertheless, it could be a very interesting experiment in the extraction genre. Both of these additions suggest that there will be some more progressions, which are desperately needed, as the PC game suffers heavily from not having any coherent progression. Join us as we talk about all of this with [[Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA27RCYBolGlkJ9FxuKw5RfgtXCEXzxqslA). No [[Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArnpK8BJQauPullIeKCtAxunX451Gme5_I) this time 😅 maybe he joins for the mobile version if it will have ads 😁
