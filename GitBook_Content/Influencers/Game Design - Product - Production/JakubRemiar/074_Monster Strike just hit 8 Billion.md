###### MIXI, Inc.’s Monster Strike just hit $8 billion 🤑 in lifetime revenue this month.

It is THE biggest gacha game of all time. Why did you never hear of it 🤨?

Because it makes 99% of its revenue from Japan market only 🇯🇵. There was an English version before, but they shut it down in 2017. Why? long story for another post 😅. It is one of the cornerstones of the mobile game industry. It is the 2nd mobile game that ever made $1 Billion in revenue and currently the 3rd mobile game in the overall lifetime revenue chart. It is still casually making $30-40 mil. a month. Even Supercell was trying to follow up on it with their now killed game Spooky pop. So what is this game about?   
  
It followed up on Puzzle & Dragons and took its meta, but changed the core. P&D has hardcore version of match3 where you can essentially combo match the whole board in one move. MS changed it into a pool style gameplay of smashing your heroes as balls against the enemies doing damage by bouncing and passing through them making it much more accessible. Even though this sounds trivial it still offers great depth for a lot of gameplay vectors and stats to tinker with. As you see in the image character speed is one of the mains stats after HP and DMG.  
  
The main star of the game is of course its gacha system. They are able to consistently add new characters to the game in exclusive gacha pools, which produce those giant revenue spikes. After 11 years these now range in multiple thousands. How can you add so much? By doing the best crossovers on the market. They already did 58 😱 different IPs with each one of them adding multiple characters. These are not only the top anime brands but also staples like Star Wars, Godzilla or Pirates of the Caribbean. These guys were doing what Fortnite is currently doing 10 years ago 🤯. Data based on Sensor Tower.
