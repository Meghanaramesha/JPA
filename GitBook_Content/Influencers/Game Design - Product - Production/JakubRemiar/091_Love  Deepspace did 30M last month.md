# Love & Deepspace did $30M last month

Love & Deepspace did $30M last month, the undisputed #1 game in the interactive story genre.

***Making 10x more than Chapters, its next competitor in the charts.***

#### *How is this possible?*

This is the next-gen interactive story game, as you see in the images. Fully 3D with voice-overs, the production quality is leagues ahead of its competition. The interactive story part plays more like a choice-based cinematic, with fully animated characters, all in the first person of your player with multiple camera angles. Surprisingly, this is just the first core gameplay that the game offers. Besides this, there is the dating part + a landscape combat RPG 😲.

#### Yes, you read that right.

The second core gameplay is an action RPG combat ⚔️, when the whole game switches from portrait to landscape, and you fight against enemies and bosses based on elemental affinities, with multiple abilities and cooldowns. All this in an interactive dating sim is unheard of! 😱

As there are only 5 love interests in the whole game, the Gacha system is based on their “memories,” so you have multiple memories per the same character, but with different rarity, skills, and stats. This way, they smartly implemented a fully fledged RPG gacha into a dating sim 😅.  
  
The dating sim itself is where this game shines, as there are so many features, from interactive messenger, characters calling you, you listening to their ASMR podcasts, photoshoots 📷, decorations, special choices trees, etc. The variety is unique and robust. The game has already made $350M since its launch during last years January. Even though 60% revenue is coming from China, there is still 12% of the US revenue as the 2nd biggest market.
