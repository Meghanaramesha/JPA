# Match Villains by Good Job Games keeps scaling aggressively!

Match Villains by [Good Job Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/goodjobgames/) continues to aggressively scale to $160K a day with 120K downloads a day in Match3 category 😲. Their downloads increased by 100% from last month? What is happening?  
  
They not only stepped up their overall UA daily spend as you see much higher download numbers 📈, but also their ad creatives production. As you see on the right part of the image, it is an example of their latest humor styled high production hooks that they use in most of their creatives currently. It is not only super polished, but it also uses a lot of humor through a short story concept. I would really like to see more creatives that are themed like this, even though that it transitions into the usual “save the king” fake gameplay 😅.  
  
On the other end we also see Royal Match not sleeping on its laurels 🥇 and continuously iterating their signature “save the king” creative concept now also with a Shark 🦈. But they also have an AI sand hook iteration, real world augmented reality, street interviews, no ads no wifi. Incidentally their current daily downloads volume is 130K a day, which is nearly the same as Match Villains.  
  
In August Creative trends episode, we again saw some interesting creatives such as Gold & Goblins iterating the resource physics through crystals this time. Playrix iterating their signature resource overload with isometric camera angles. Century games testing their own version of Voodoo’s Mob Control cannon creative. Idle Lumber continuing their cutting creatives, 😱 and many more that we shown.
