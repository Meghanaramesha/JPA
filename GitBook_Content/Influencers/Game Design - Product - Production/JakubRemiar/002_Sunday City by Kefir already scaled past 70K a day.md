Sunday City by [Kefir](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kefir-/) already scaled past $70K a day 🤑 in a month from its launch and it is not stopping down. What is this game? Are you asking what is in the picture? Yesss 😎 get the run down here:

This is again a masterwork of “fake ads” into “fake onboarding” into real LTV game setup.

The game literally start as GTA Vice city, with full 3rd person view controls, you get your café, car collection, clothes and fully 3D world to roam around. But then, quite soon you get a quest to go to a casino in the city. This basically unlocks the real core loop of the game 🎰, which is playing slot machines of all different kinds. For the money you win you renovate city business in the city in the same exact style as you would build up your Coin Master village or Monopoly GO towns.  
  
So essentially this game is following up the latest trend in the social casino / coin looters category, where similarly to 4X, games are building “onboarding games” to match the fake ad creatives, which lowers the giant social casino CPI.

Both Top Tycoon and Carnival tycoon already breached $200K 💸 per day with this strategy by using the theme park idle game as the onboarding and ad creatives strategy. The kicker here is that this game was soft launched in November 2023 already in this state, which means it was way ahead of its time, with this setup. Congrats to the Kefir team for doing this 4D chess 😁.  
  
As we predicted on other episodes, this strategy is coming to multiple genres with high LTV metagame engines, as there is no other way for them to scale users in the current market through UA.
