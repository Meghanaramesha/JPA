##### [Rivergame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivergame/)‘s Last Z Survival Shooter scaled to $300K a day in revenue.

This time they used the [Tap4Fun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tap4fun/)‘s Top Girl spin on the onboarding. How can they scale so many games so fast? 😵

The game is done again in their now signature template, of hypercasual runner/shooter during onboarding and then transitions to 4X. Except this time, we have AI-generated girls on top. The 4X engine ⚔️ that they are perfecting since releasing Top War in 2019 is just getting better and better with every next game they release. The game is now landscape instead of portrait, contrary to the rest of their portfolio, but it works even better because of the AI girls functionality they are focusing on.   
  
And let me tell you that they supercharged ⚡ what Top Girl did and turned it into their own AI-powered version of OnlyFans. Instead of random pictures and chat in between the levels in Top Girl, here you have an energy-powered chat where every reply costs energy, ending the sequence with AI generated sexy photo of a girl that is literally worth around $9 hard currency value of energy per piece!😮 The hero layer is now a fully fledged waifu layer with dating mechanics, photos, chats, love villa, collection album, costumes, and other AI girl-driven mechanics.  
  
Obviously all this is AI girls focus is again done by User Acquisition strategy, even though they are not yet in the creatives of the game. But by seeing what Top Girl is doing with their creatives, I think they are just picking up steam until we see the exact same creative concepts, fully generated with AI 🤖 all over again. This “unique” AI iteration has now become a trend and has been picked up by the biggest 4X player in the market, which is scaling it aggressively. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) & [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) in a very 🌶️ episode 😎.
