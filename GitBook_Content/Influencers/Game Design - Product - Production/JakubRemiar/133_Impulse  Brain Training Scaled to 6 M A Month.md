###### Impulse – Brain Training scaled to $6 Mil. a month 🤑 overall revenue with around 3 Mil. downloads a month.

It’s the current downloads & revenue leader in the health & wellness category. Why are we talking about it? Because in the end this a collection of hypercasual games 🕹 posing as an app to improve your brain 🧠. What a difference a change of expectations makes 😁.  
  
The impulse goes a long way to make sure everything looks like a health improvement app rather than the typical hypercasual game. Every day you complete a set of 3 games as part of your “training program”. These are categorized into different cognitive areas such as Memory, Mental Math ➗, Problem Solving, and Attention (30 different ones). After you have done your daily training you can still play different games, but only 6+1 daily are free, others are locked behind a subscription 💰. These have hundreds of levels with increasing difficulty based on the trending hypercasual gameplays such as words crossword, sort puzzle, etc.  
  
On top of it, you can do tests for General IQ, ADHD, Anxiety, Personality, etc. Again results of these are locked behind a subscription 💸. The app runs interstitials between the levels of the minigames and banners during the test answers. It also has a very specific nudging process towards pushing you towards removal of ads offer as [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) explains on the podcast 😅 .  
  
The best part comes with the UA as Matej 🦩 shows on the pod, where the creatives are pretty much a combination of different trends mainly “fake psychological tests” and other “only psychopath can solve this” variations 😅. An app version of our well-known fake ads system. This UA know-how is probably one of the main differentiators between the other “apps” trying to achieve this same result. [Join us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=SUsHbCeMIfvdkMWm&v=yfI-rZNCi0M&feature=youtu.be) as we talk about all of these and much more in this detective episode 🕵‍♂️.
