###### Path of Exile 2 did some very smart decisions 💡 during their Early Access launch. I finally got to the endgame, so we have a full review for you, explaining their unique “convenience” based monetization and content distribution 😎.

As seen on the image, the team heavily focused on the endgame part of the game instead of early campaign. Rather than developing a long and costly campaign, they actually developed only 3 acts and then recycled them with a higher “cruel” difficulty. This enabled them to shift the capacity of the team towards endgame, where players will spend most of their time ⌛ anyway, instead of the 25 hour long campaign, which you will never interact with after reaching the end of it. This is a completely opposite strategy to Diablo 4, which had a very well polished campaign with heavy story, but then ended up with an empty endgame with no additional progression systems during its launch.

The endgame is very robust already because the team brought around 8 progression system from Path of Exile 1, which is basically 3 additional years of player tested and fully developed mechanics. [Grinding Gear Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grinding-gear-games/) is basically the [Habby](https://www.linkedin.com/company/habbyfun/) of PC free to play. By carefully iterating their ARPG genre know how and building their template, they now have a giant head start that no other ARPG on the market can compete 🏆 with in terms of content. The full game will be released in 6-12 months as free to play, which will then release with full 6 campaign acts and even more fleshed out and fine tuned endgame.  
  
Regarding the monetization, all of the purchases from Path of Exile 1, will automatically transfer to the new game, as they will run in parallel. Its not only cosmetics but also mainly convenience items such as special stash tabs, which is the secret behind the game’s success. The stash tabs not only gives you a much more comfortable inventory experience, but they also enable you to sell your items on the official auction house 💹. This way the game is still completely free to play, but its also not driven by cosmetics only, where utility provides a much more desired purchase.
