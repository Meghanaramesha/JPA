# AI hooks in mobile game creatives are evolving.

AI hooks in mobile game creatives are evolving. Now you not only need a great AI hook, but also a seamless transition into the creative itself 😎

We have seen more and more AI generated hooks being used at the start of the ad creatives lately. They are mainly based on the either shock value 😱, being weird or overly bizarre. This had a problem that after this, they would sharply cut into a completely different creative concept.   
  
Now you need to seamlessly transition them into your ad, so that once you capture the user’s attention with the hook, it continues smoothly into your whole creative concept, so the ad is consistent from start to the end 😁. (Examples from Lands of Jail)   
  
In May Creative trends episode we again saw some interesting creatives such as Gold & Goblins iterating the resource overload through gates, Royal Match sending the king on a rocket 🚀 through concrete slabs, Top Heroes going full Idle Outpost, Township iterating Pizza Ready, Kingshot doubling down on their Thronefall concept also using a lot of AI, Total Battle killing it with real life Romans 🏛️, and of course Lands of Jail being the winner of “Best AI creatives” for the last month 🏆.
