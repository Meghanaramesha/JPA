# More money raised ≠ higher chances of success.

More money raised isn’t equal to higher chances of success.

I’ve launched two studios and learned this first-hand.  
  
I once believed:  
more investment → more resources → more chances → instant win.  
  
Sounds logical, right?  
Wrong.  
  
Funding and success don’t walk hand-in-hand.  
Sometimes they sprint in opposite directions.  
  
Why?  
  
• You hire pricey specialists.  
• Investors expect quick, outsized returns.  
• A big round invites big spending, cash isn’t raised to sit still.  
• The small startup turns into a flaming train laying track at speed.  
  
Steering becomes nearly impossible.  
Mistakes get zero buffer.  
  
Massive funding turns your venture into a moonshot:  
-> hit the bullseye and strike gold  
-> miss and lose it all.  
  
A lean studio plays a different game:  
  
• Ship one small, profitable title.  
• Reinvest.  
• Ship the next, slightly bigger.  
• Repeat.  
  
Step by step, you still reach a breakout hit, just not overnight.  
  
Think of the hare and the tortoise.  
The cash-flooded studio is the hare.  
The bootstrapped indie is the tortoise.  
  
We know who wins the race.
