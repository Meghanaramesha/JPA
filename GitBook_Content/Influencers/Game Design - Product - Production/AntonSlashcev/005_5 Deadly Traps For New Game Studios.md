###### 5 Deadly Traps For New Game Studios

1. Passion Project. Zero Validation  
New studio builds the game they dream about, but never checks market, benchmarks or ICP  
  
-> Beautiful game. Empty servers  
  
  
2. First Game = Huge Game  
Open world, MMO systems, online co-op, custom engine, dozens of features at once  
  
-> Endless production. runway gone before version 1  
  
  
3. Friends First. Roles Later  
Hire buddies. No clear responsibilities, no performance expectations, no hard talks  
  
-> Drama, slow delivery, founder burnout from doing everything  
  
  
4. Copy The Hit. Hope For Luck  
Clone top charts. same theme, same mechanics, no sharp angle or insight  
  
-> Looks familiar. Plays worse. Buried by algorithms and stores  
  
5. Great Game Does Not Need Marketing  
Team believes “if we build it, players will come”, no UA, no community, no store work  
  
-> Invisible launch. no audience, no data, partners assume the game failed
