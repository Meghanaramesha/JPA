###### Who’s actually playing your game?

Understanding your players is key to designing experiences they’ll love.   
  
One of the best ways to do that:   
Use 𝘽𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙡𝙚’𝙨 𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙚𝙧 𝙏𝙮𝙥𝙚𝙨 to identify what motivates them.   
  
Here’s a quick breakdown:   
  
💀 𝗞𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘀   
• What drives them: Dominance   
• How they play: Raid others, trash talk, dominate in PvP   
• How to design for them: Competitive modes, ranked ladders, PvP arenas (while keeping toxicity in check)   
  
🏆 𝗔𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀   
• What drives them: Rewards and mastery   
• How they play: Grind levels, complete quests, collect rare items   
• How to design for them: Clear progression systems, leaderboards, milestone rewards   
  
💬 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗿𝘀   
• What drives them: Connection and collaboration   
• How they play: Chat, form guilds, join co-op missions   
• How to design for them: Robust social features, friend lists, community events   
  
🧭 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗿𝘀   
• What drives them: Discovery and curiosity   
• How they play: Find easter eggs, map the world, talk to NPCs

They find ways to satisfy them all.
