###### How to design a great First-Time User Experience

Together with [devtodev](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devtodev/), we’ve compiled a list of tips for FTUE:  
  
𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮 𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸.   
• First impressions matter.   
• Grab attention with visuals, a quick story, or a fun challenge.   
• Highlight what makes your game unique (art, story, mechanics).   
  
𝟮. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿.   
• Show players what to do immediately.   
• Use short, skippable instructions (e.g., tooltips, highlights).   
• Let actions teach—avoid long explanations.   
  
𝟯. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆.   
• Unveil one mechanic at a time.   
• Reinforce learning before adding more.   
• Reward players for mastering new features.   
• Use animations or story to connect mechanics to gameplay.   
  
𝟰. 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻.   
• Early wins = emotional investment.   
• Keep first levels easy for high success rates.   
• Show progress with bars, collectibles, or milestones.   
• Celebrate with sound or visual effects.   
  
𝟱. 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.   
• Avoid early sales—it can feel pushy.   
• Offer free premium items to show value.   
• Introduce purchases after players understand gameplay.   
• Use optional ads that provide rewards.   
  
𝟲. 𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀.   
• Social features boost retention.   
• Encourage sharing, inviting friends, or joining guilds.   
• Offer rewards for social actions.   
• Keep prompts optional and friendly.   
  
𝟳. 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁, 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲, 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲.   
• Use data to find drop-off points.   
• A/B test onboarding flows.   
• Track tutorial completion rates and analyze feedback.   
• Heatmaps can show where players struggle or leave.   
  
𝟴. 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗻𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗙𝗧𝗨𝗘.
