###### Want to be a top 1% game producer?

Here are 20 lessons every great game producer lives by:   
  
1. Passion matters.   
↳ You can’t lead gamers without being one.   
  
2. Own your mistakes.   
↳ Transparency builds trust within your team.   
  
3. No decision is perfect.   
↳ Every choice comes with trade-offs and uncertainty.   
  
4. There’s no magic formula.   
↳ Chasing mythical insights leads to failure.   
  
5. Iteration is key.   
↳ No game starts perfect—refine it continuously.   
  
6. Ideas are worthless without execution.   
↳ Cool ideas are common; great execution is rare.   
  
7. Respect your players.   
↳ Treat them like valued guests, or they’ll leave.   
  
8. Fun comes first.   
↳ Features or monetization can’t fix a boring game.   
  
9. Start small, succeed big.   
↳ Prove a small concept before scaling up.   
  
10. Profit is the ultimate measure of success.   
↳ Revenue means nothing if the game isn’t profitable.   
  
11. Players aren’t fools.   
↳ They see through shortcuts and cheap tricks.   
  
12. Good games aren’t always successful.   
↳ Acknowledge that even great games can fail.   
  
13. Your team defines your greatness.   
↳ Surround yourself with talented people.   
  
14. Vision is your compass.   
↳ Without it, your team will wander aimlessly.   
  
15. Engage with your community.   
↳ Ignoring players means losing touch with your audience.   
  
16. Balance innovation with best practices.   
↳ Too much or too little can cost you players.   
  
17. Analytics are your best friend.   
↳ Flying blind without data leads to mistakes.   
  
18. Manage time effectively.   
↳ Missed deadlines can ruin even the best projects.   
  
19. Never stop learning.   
↳ Trends and tech evolve—stay ahead.   
  
20. Prioritize health.   
↳ Burnout harms creativity, your team, and your game.
