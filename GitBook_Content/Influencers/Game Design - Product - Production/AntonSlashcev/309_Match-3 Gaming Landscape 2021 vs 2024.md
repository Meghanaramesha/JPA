##### In just three years, the top-10 match-3 games have seen a dramatic shift.

**August 2021:**  
• Candy Crush Saga led the pack with $77.7M in revenue  
• Homescapes and Gardenscapes held strong, both exceeding $40M  
• Fishdom and Candy Crush Soda Saga rounded out the top 5  
  
**Fast forward to July 2024:**  
• Royal Match skyrocketed with an incredible 394% increase  
• Candy Crush Saga remains strong, growing by 12% to $86.8M.  
• Match Masters experienced 48% growth  
  
**However, several popular titles have declined:**  
• Homescapes dropped 48%.  
• Candy Crush Soda Saga fell 27%.  
• Project Makeover plummeted by 55%.  
• LINE PokoPoko saw a 44% decrease.  
  
**What’s happening?**  
↳ Match-3 games with simplified meta (Royal Match, Match Masters) are overtaking those with deeper meta (Homescapes, Project Makeover).  
↳ These faster-paced games are growing revenue and taking audiences from slower, more complex titles.  
  
**Why?**  
↳ In the “post-TikTok” era, speed and high dynamics are key.  
↳ Games with a slower pace struggle to keep up with the demand for fast-paced content, leading to a decline in their popularity.  
  
*I expect this trend to continue.*
