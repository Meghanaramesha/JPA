# The puzzle genre is overheating

#### The puzzle genre is overheating

The most released subgenres across ALL mobile genres in the past year:  
  
• Block Puzzle  
• Sort Puzzle  
• Screw Puzzle  
  
📱 Over 1,000 new games per genre.  
That’s more than 3 new games every single day.  
  
No other puzzle subgenre — or even non-puzzle genre — comes close  
  
Yes, they’re popular  
Yes, they’re growing  
But the competition is exploding  
  
If you’re building puzzle games right now, you need a crystal clear product strategy  
Without it, your game will disappear in the crowd  
  
What actually helps puzzle games break through:  
  
 • 🕹️ Unique mechanic combinations that feel fresh but still simple (like Coffee Mania)  
 • 🧶 Real-world analogies that reduce CPI thanks to instant recognition (like Color Block Jam with Lego, or Wool Sort with yarn)  
 • 🏠 A surprising twist on a known mechanic (like Screw Away going 3D)  
 • 🔁 Active live ops that keep players coming back (like Magic Sort)  
  
The puzzle space is hot   
But only the most thoughtful games will survive
