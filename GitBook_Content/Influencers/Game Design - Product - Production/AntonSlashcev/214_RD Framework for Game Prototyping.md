###### 🕹 R&D Framework for Game Prototyping 🕹

Below is the framework we often use when starting work on new projects:  
  
I. Pre-Production (2-4 weeks)  
1. Idea Generation:   
  
▶ Market analysis, gathering references;   
▶ Brainstorming to pick the most promising ideas  
  
2. Greybox Prototyping:   
  
▶ Focus on a single core feature;   
▶ Find the fun factor  
  
3. Conceptualization:   
  
▶ Preparing the GDD, user flow, and key shots;  
▶ Selecting the right tools and creating a roadmap  
  
II. Production (4-10 weeks)  
  
4. Features Development:   
  
▶ Concentrate on key gameplay mechanics and speed in development;  
▶ Minimal meta or progression  
  
5. Content Creation:   
  
▶ Craft key art, and fun levels, and use ready-made assets;  
▶ Secondary art, vfx, sounds, etc. can be draft  
  
6. Minimum Viable Product:   
  
▶ Ensure the game offers 20-40 minutes of engaging gameplay with a distinctive style and polished game feel  
▶ Better fewer, but better  
  
III. Product-Market Fit Validation (1-3 weeks)  
  
7. QA & Playtesting:   
  
▶ Conduct thorough testing, optimize performance, and balance difficulty  
  
8. Marketing Preparation:   
  
▶ Create captivating marketing materials;  
▶ Focus on highlighting short but impactful gameplay moments  
  
9. Validation Test:   
  
▶ For Mobile: measure CPI, Day 1 Retention, and Playtime through the Facebook ads channel  
▶ For PC: Collect feedback from players and publishers and assess virality using game expos, Steam Demo, and social networks like Reddit and Twitter  
  
🔍 Decisions Based on Results:  
  
✅ Great Results? Advance to full-scale production!  
🔁 Borderline Results? Iterate and polish further.  
🔴 No Results? Start over with a fresh idea.  
  
The whole point of this framework is to avoid wasting extra resources and time on something that will later change or be discarded due to the lack of product-market fit.

DISCLAIMER: This framework is NOT a “one-size-fits-all” solution for all genres and business models, nor is it the only possible one. However, it is effective for small and medium teams without a huge budget who are working on new casual, hybrid-casual, or indie games.
