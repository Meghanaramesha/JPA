# Making an indie game is actually easy.

Making an indie game is actually easy:

You just need an amazing game idea.  
And validate player interest with zero budget.  
And build a prototype stable enough to reach the end credits.  
And get streamers genuinely excited about it.  
And figure out if players will pay more than a cup of coffee.  
  
You should be able to code gameplay mechanics.  
And create appealing art assets.  
And compose catchy music tracks.  
And design engaging levels.  
And handle server meltdowns at 2 am when saves vanish.  
  
You should understand player acquisition.  
And why that differs from player retention.  
And why that’s different from getting wishlists.  
And why all that differs from achieving profitability.  
And don’t overlook crowdfunding.  
  
And the subtle art of pitching when your “studio” is you and your cat.  
And basic revenue forecasting.  
And recognizing growth beyond just follower counts.  
And knowing pivoting isn’t giving up.  
But understanding when both matter.  
  
You need to negotiate rev-share fairly with your team.  
And hire when steady paychecks aren’t guaranteed.  
And keep your team inspired,  
Even when no one’s seen a paycheck for months.  
And explain to family why you left that stable job for “games.”  
  
You should learn a bit about marketing,  
And community management,  
And data-driven game design,  
And player feedback analysis,  
And basic accounting,  
And ratings boards,  
And crisis PR,  
And everything else that keeps your studio afloat.  
  
You need to move quickly.  
But not so quickly you ship game-breaking bugs.  
Yet never so slowly you miss your launch window.  
You should be confident, not delusional.  
Resourceful, not reckless.  
Persistent, not pushy.  
Hopeful, not naive.  
  
Like I said.  
Easy.  
It’s just pixels, passion, and perseverance.
