# Mobile Games Live-Ops Cheat Sheet

##### **The ultimate goal of any product changes in a game is to increase LTV.**

However, LTV is a rather general metric, and changes in it are hard to measure after each individual update.  
  
🎯 Therefore, it’s better to focus on improving 4 fundamental metrics, each of which will ultimately enhance LTV – either directly or indirectly, over time.

##### **4️⃣ Key Metrics:**

**1. Retention  
2. Playtime  
3. Conversion to paying user  
4. ARPU (Daily / Weekly)**  
  
**🔍 Once you determine which metric you want to influence, you should choose an appropriate aspect that can be improved in this regard.**  
> For example, improve the game Meta to enhance long-term Retention.  
  
**Some aspects of the game can influence several key metrics simultaneously:**  
> For instance, exciting competitions with other players can both increase ARPDAU and Playtime 🏆  
  
**And some changes might improve one metric at the expense of another:**  
> By increasing difficulty and enhancing paywalls, you can increase Conversion, but at the same time Drop Retention (More players will start paying, but also more Churn) 😕  
  
⚖️ Therefore, it is often important to find an optimal balance between the impacts of changes on different metrics.  
  
**DISCLAIMER: This cheat sheet is a simplified approach to Live-Ops.**

In reality, many aspects are more interconnected, and sometimes it’s important to influence other, more specific metrics such as Average Check or ARPPU.

*Also, other genre-specific changes can influence the key metrics.*
