Key Updates & Features  
  
**1. Bullets and Burgers (Seasonal Event)**  
• Season Pass: Players can earn rewards through milestones using Gems.  
• Monetization: The Premium Pass is the main monetization strategy.  
• Gameplay Mechanics: Players can now earn final rewards repeatedly by using Gems, enhancing engagement and session frequency.  
• Additional Content: New reskins include ‘The Desolation of Chickens,’ ‘Moonlight Matchup,’ and ‘Beach Party.’  
  
**2. Get a Spell!**  
• Unlock Abilities: Players must use active abilities in core gameplay to unlock new ones.  
• Extended Event: Now running for 4 days to keep players engaged longer.  
• Player Engagement: This update boosts session numbers and player retention, potentially increasing monetization.  
  
**3. Sneak Peek! Lava World (New Map and Content)**• New Map: Introducing “Lava World” with a fresh gameplay loop that requires players to collect resources to unlock content.  
• Monetization: Features Special Offers with exclusive content points.  
  
**4. Game Update (Balancing and Expansion)**• Monetization Adjustments: MEGA (pay-2-win mechanic) is removed from the game, now it’s a skin.

• Balance Tweaks: Adjustments to rewards, difficulty, and content variety for a better gaming experience.  
  
The recent updates are all about boosting player engagement and retention.  
  
I don’t think that this alone will be enough for Squad Busters to return to stable previous revenue levels.  
  
But it’s a step in the right direction.
