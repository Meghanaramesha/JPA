# 3 Layers of Game Design

![](https://www.gamigion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3-Layers-of-Game-Design.jpg)

###### Many studios design games backwards.

They start with:   
• UI/UX   
• Visual effects   
• Animations   
• Sound and music   
  
But polish can’t save a weak game.   
  
The real magic?   
It starts at the core.   
  
Great games are built from the inside out.   
  
There are 3 layers you need to get right:   
  
𝟭. 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 🕹️  
This is the heart of your game.   
• Fun mechanics   
• Core loop   
• Game feel   
• Risk and reward   
• Clear objectives   
  
If this isn’t strong, nothing else matters.   
  
𝟮. 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 🔄  
Once the core works, build around it.   
• Progression   
• Difficulty curve   
• Resource management   
• Skills and upgrades   
• Social features   
  
This keeps players coming back.   
  
𝟯. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 🎨  
Now make it beautiful.   
• Art style   
• Narrative and lore   
• World map   
• Environment details   
• Animations   
  
This makes your game memorable.   
  
So before you polish, stop and ask:   
Is the core fun?
