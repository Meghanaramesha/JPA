###### Meta vs. Progression in Games: What’s the Difference?

These two concepts often get mixed up, but they serve different purposes.  
  
1. Meta  
Meta refers to anything that motivates players outside of direct gameplay advantages.   
  
↳ Think of cosmetic items, skins, storylines, or leaderboards.   
↳ Meta keeps players engaged but doesn’t change how the game is played  
  
2. Progression  
Progression, on the other hand, directly affects gameplay.   
  
↳ Leveling up, unlocking abilities, or gaining in-game power-ups, etc.  
↳ These rewards help players advance and unlock new gameplay experiences.  
  
3. There are also cases where Meta and Progression overlap.   
  
↳ For example, unlocking a new character may offer cool visuals and a backstory (meta) while also giving new abilities (progression).  
  
Both are crucial for player engagement but serve different roles.
