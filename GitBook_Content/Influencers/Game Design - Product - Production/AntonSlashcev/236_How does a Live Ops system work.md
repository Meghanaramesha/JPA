###### How does a Live Ops system work?

Here’s a breakdown, based on the [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) research:  
  
1. Offers 💰  
 • Starter packs, season passes, and rolling deals.  
 • Monetize player defeats and the desire to speed up progress.  
  
2. New content 🎉  
 • Themed, seasonal, and late-game updates.  
 • Keeps gameplay fresh and incentivizes players to explore further.  
  
3. Mini-games 🎮  
 • Fun additions like treasure hunts or Plinko.  
 • Add variety and unlock new monetization opportunities.  
  
4. Win streaks 🔥  
 • Create FOMO and loss aversion.  
 • Motivate players to extend sessions and chase bonuses.  
  
5. Task-based events ✅  
 • Daily quests, challenges, and milestone rewards.  
 • Provide short- and long-term goals to keep players grinding.  
  
6. Tournaments 🏆  
 • Solo, team, and weekly competitions.  
 • Heighten excitement, especially when competing with friends.  
  
7. Time-limited bonuses ⏳  
 • Extra lives, reduced costs, or double rewards.  
 • Drive urgency and encourage players to act now.  
  
8. Social features 🤝  
 • Clans, teams, and friend groups.  
 • Build community, loyalty, and a reason to return.  
  
At its core, Live Ops is about keeping players engaged while enhancing monetization opportunities.
