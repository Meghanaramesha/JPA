###### Puzzle games are harder to make than they look.

𝗣𝘂𝘇𝘇𝗹𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗯𝗲:  
• Fun to solve  
• Simple to understand  
• Challenging, but fair  
  
𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲:  
• Instant feedback – players need to see their actions matter   
• A satisfying “aha” moment – when everything clicks   
• Multiple ways to solve – creativity over one “right” answer   
• Balanced difficulty – no massive spikes or dead ends   
  
A great puzzle feels like a conversation, not a lecture.  
  
𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀?  
• Clean, responsive controls   
• Clear goals   
• Mechanics like matching, merging, rotating   
• Limits (time, moves, resources)   
• Optional hints or boosters   
• Rewards that feel earned   
  
𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝘂𝘇𝘇𝗹𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘀:  
1. Random-based – like Match-3 (depends on luck)   
2. Skill-based – like Sudoku or The Room (pure logic)  
  
𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝘃𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀:  
• Regular = steady progress   
• Bonus = quick rewards   
• Paywall = tough levels that tempt purchases   
• Tutorial = teach new mechanics   
• Boosters-washout = designed so power-ups don’t help much   
• Combo = multiple mechanics, high complexity   
  
𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿’𝘀 𝗷𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆:  
• Start easy. Introduce one rule at a time.   
• Scale complexity slowly.   
• Add new mechanics that build on the old ones.   
• Keep the experience smooth and stable.   
  
𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗽𝘀:  
• Too many mechanics too fast   
• Unclear objectives   
• Sudden difficulty spikes   
• Laggy or confusing feedback   
  
Whether it’s Wordle, Candy Crush, or The Room,   
great puzzle games all follow these principles.  
  
Thinking of making your own?  
Start small. Start clever.  
And design for the “aha” moment.
