# My honest advice for Game Producers

###### My honest advice for game producers:

If you don’t love playing games, you shouldn’t be making them.  
  
Because if you make a game only to “earn a buck,” then:  
  
• Your game will lack fun.  
• It will lack depth.  
• And it won’t truly engage players.  
  
… resulting in earning $0 (and probably losing much more).  
  
Only true gamers can create what players love, and this will be rewarded in the end.  
  
Passion for games is what makes great ones.  
Always.
