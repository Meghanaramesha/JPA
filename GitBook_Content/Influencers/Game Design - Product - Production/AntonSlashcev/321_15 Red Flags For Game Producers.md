##### If you hear statements like these – RUN! 🚩

1) “The more meetings we have, the faster tasks get done!”

2) “I don’t care about player feedback; we just make money.”

3) “I don’t need market research; I have a Vision.”

4) “I don’t need a Vision; I have market research.”

5) “We won’t use new tools; everyone is already used to Excel!”

6) “We need to add AI because everyone else is adding it.”

7) “I listen to those I like and ignore the rest of the team.”

8) “I don’t trust my team and personally check every task.”

9) “If I’m crunching, everyone must crunch.”

10) “I could do this task faster myself; why does it take the developer so long?”

11) “I don’t have time to play other games; I’m busy developing our game.”

12) “No one is indispensable; the team is just parts of a big machine.”

13) “I’m higher ranked than others, so my opinion always matters more.”

14) “We don’t need planning; we’ll develop the game for as long as it takes.”

15) “We will meet the deadline even if we have to release a bad product”
