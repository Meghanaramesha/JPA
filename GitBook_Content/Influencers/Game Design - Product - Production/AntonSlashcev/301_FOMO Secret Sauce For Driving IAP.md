# FOMO: Secret Sauce For Driving IAP

**It’s everywhere:**  
• Offers and discounts  
• Limited-time events  
• Time-pressing mechanics  
• Short-term boosts like Happy Hours  
• Player tournaments  
  
FOMO taps into a basic human instinct, making it incredibly effective.  
  
**But here’s the catch:**  
→ A ticking clock alone won’t help if you sell sh\*t.  
  
FOMO works best when paired with something players already want.  
Something that has value.  
  
→ Then FOMO is the final nudge that pushes players past indecision.  
  
So, before you add that timer, ensure your offering is worth it.
