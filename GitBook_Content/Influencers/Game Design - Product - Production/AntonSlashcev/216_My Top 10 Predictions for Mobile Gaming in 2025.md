###### My Top 10 Predictions for Mobile Gaming in 2025:

1. 🚨 Stagnation ahead  
 • Expect slow growth in revenue and a slight drop in downloads. Rising costs for user acquisition and marketing are making things tough.  
  
2. 💳 Alternative stores take the stage  
 • Developers are moving to platforms like Amazon, Appstore or Galaxy Store and embracing web payments to avoid heavy app store fees.  
  
3. 🤝 IP collaborations will thrive  
 • Big games are teaming up with famous brands for live-ops events. It’s a marketing and engagement win-win.  
  
4. 🧩 Puzzle games rise to the top  
• Puzzle games will dominate revenue growth, while action, arcade, and simulation games lead in downloads.  
  
5. ⚡ Hybrid casual is the new trendsetter  
 • Games with simple yet engaging mechanics are blending monetization models and extending live-ops.  
  
6. 📈 M&A heats up  
• Major players will expand portfolios through acquisitions, with investments focused on tools and platforms over new studios.  
  
7.🤖 AI: important but not revolutionary  
• AI will assist with asset creation and coding but won’t drive major market analysis or conceptual innovation.  
  
8.🚪 Indie challenges grow  
• Small teams will struggle against big publishers and shift their focus to platforms like Fortnite, Roblox, and Telegram.  
  
9. 🌐 Social live-ops rise  
• Solo games will integrate more features like clans, leaderboards, and PvP modes to build community engagement.  
  
10. 📢 Ads in casual games  
 • Ad-driven campaigns will become the go-to strategy for monetizing non-paying players in casual games.
