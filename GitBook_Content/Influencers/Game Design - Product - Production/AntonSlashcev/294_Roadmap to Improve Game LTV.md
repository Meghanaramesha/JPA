# Roadmap to Improve Game LTV

###### A roadmap to improve a game’s LTV isn’t as complicated as it sounds.

Here’s a straightforward process to follow:  
  
1. Nail short-term retention first.   
↳ Focus on optimizing the onboarding experience to hook players  
  
2. Drive high engagement.   
↳ Make a compelling and fun gameplay loop   
  
3. Then, focus on long-term retention.   
↳ Add new content and features  
↳ Create strong progression and goals to keep players invested over time  
  
4. Convert players into paying users.   
↳ Create resource shortage and offer tailored starter packs   
  
5. Increase payment frequency.   
↳ Add time-limited deals or season passes to encourage consistent spending  
  
6. Raise the average transaction value.   
↳ Offer high-value bundles and adjust prices based on player segmentation  
  
7. Explore additional revenue streams.   
↳ Experiment with ads and subscription tiers through A/B testing   
  
→ The challenge lies in the execution.   
• Each step offers multiple approaches.   
• And your success depends on how well you implement them.  
  
But with the roadmap, you’re not just guessing.   
You’re identifying the problem areas and taking targeted action.
