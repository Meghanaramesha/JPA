# One simple truth mobile game devs often forget.

Behind every purchase in your game – there’s a real person.  
  
ARPU isn’t just a dashboard number.  
Conversion rate isn’t just a statistically significant metric.  
  
Behind every transaction, every purchase, every subscription, every watched ad – there are real people.   
  
Real players.  
  
Players who:  
• Feel emotions  
• Celebrate victories  
• Compete with friends  
• Anticipate the next level  
• Get frustrated by defeats  
• Have real fun with your game  
• Sink into a cozy atmosphere after work  
  
And so on.  
  
Don’t let your players down.  
Build monetization that creates value, not systems that squeeze every cent.  
  
Because if real players don’t feel rewarded, they won’t pay you.
