###### How to Design Difficulty in Puzzle Games

Based on the [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) research, here is a guide to designing difficulty:  
  
1. Offer multiple difficulty tiers  
 • Easy, Hard, Super Hard — with clear visuals to indicate the level.  
  
2. Use attempts, not win rate, to tune difficulty  
 • Low attempts (1–3) = Easy  
 • High attempts (20–35) = Hard  
  
3. Follow a recommended difficulty curve  
 • Start easy (Levels 1–20) to build confidence  
 • Add a hard spike (Levels 20–30) to create challenge  
 • Introduce progressive increases and major paywalls after Level 50  
  
4. Gradually introduce mechanics  
• Let players master core gameplay before adding complexity.  
  
5. Reward wisely  
• Scale rewards with difficulty. Tougher levels should yield better prizes.  
  
6. Test and iterate  
• Track completion rates.   
• Adjust blocker levels.   
• Fine-tune using player feedback.  
• Alternate between challenging and easier phases.  
   
Make the game feel “just challenged enough” to keep trying.  
Good puzzle design isn’t just about difficulty — it’s about balance.
