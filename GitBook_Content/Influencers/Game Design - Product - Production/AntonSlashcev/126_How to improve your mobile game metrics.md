#### How to improve your mobile game metrics?

From retention to monetization, here’s what the best teams focus on:  
  
1. 🎮 First-Time User Experience  
 • Focus: D1 retention, tutorial completion  
 • Keep tutorials short, clear, and rewarding  
 • Add early premium rewards or bonus levels  
 • Avoid aggressive monetization or long tutorials  
  
2. ⏱ Short-Term Engagement  
 • Focus: D3–D7 retention, level churn  
 • Build clear player progression  
 • Use daily quests, upgrade systems, progress bars  
 • Make progression feel valuable, not trivial  
  
3. 🔁 Long-Term Engagement  
 • Focus: D30–D90 retention, sticky factor  
 • Introduce long-term goals and meta layers  
 • Add global maps, leaderboards, customization  
 • Balance grind with meaningful rewards to prevent burnout  
  
4. 🕹 Core Gameplay  
 • Focus: Session length, playtime  
 • Polish mechanics and controls  
 • Add dynamic difficulty, diverse enemies, win streaks  
 • Strong core loop is essential—don’t patch it later  
  
5. 💰 IAP Monetization  
 • Focus: Conversion rate, ARPU, ARPPU  
 • Offer personalized deals, appealing starter packs  
 • Use scarcity, bundles, and player segmentation  
 • Avoid aggressive pricing—hurts retention  
  
6. 📺 Ads Monetization  
 • Focus: CPM, fill rate, ads per player  
 • Place ads at natural pauses with small rewards  
 • Consider RV ads and no-ads offers  
 • Intrusive ads = player churn  
  
7. ⚖️ Game Balance  
 • Focus: Difficulty curve, win/loss ratio  
 • Add resource sinks but allow free paths  
 • Use adaptive difficulty, soft/hard currency systems  
 • Don’t balance everything to average—keep choices meaningful  
  
8. 👥 Social Features  
 • Focus: Social engagement, community activity  
 • Make player interactions easy and rewarding  
 • Add clans, PvP, and referral programs  
 • Excessive pressure can push away casual players  
  
9. 🗓 Live Ops  
 • Focus: Event participation, ARPDAU, DAU  
 • Keep events fresh and motivating  
 • Study competitors, run seasonal content and tournaments  
 • Too many events = burnout
