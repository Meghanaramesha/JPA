###### Season Pass can drive both engagement and monetization if done right.

❌ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱:  
• Unclear reward rules and mismatched item sizes = visual mess  
• Currency for premium pass purchase isn’t labeled clearly  
• Elements are cut off, players need to scroll to see key info  
• Main event window overlays core game UI (clutter alert)  
• Huge banners distract instead of inform  
• Similar buttons serve different functions (confusing!)  
  
✅ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱:  
• Visibly separate free and paid rewards  
• Two buttons → same goal: purchase window (without distraction)  
• Use icon variety to signal event structure and pass benefits  
• Highlight goals with a special frame—sets expectations  
• Display event in full window to avoid background clutter  
  
The best Season Passes balance:  
→ Clarity  
→ Motivation  
→ Minimal distractions  
  
Design with purpose.  
Reward with intention.  
Your players will thank you for it.
