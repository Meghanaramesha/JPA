###### Push Notifications Guide

Based on the [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) research, here’s how to master push notifications:  
  
1. Time-Based Notifications  
 • Game reminders after 24 hours of inactivity  
 • Daily bonuses for rewards  
 • Limited-time offer alerts  
 • Event notifications (start, mid-event, and end reminders)  
 • Booster expiration warnings  
  
2. Action-Based Notifications  
 • Achievement unlocked: Celebrate player milestones  
 • Friend/enemy activity: Updates on gifts, requests, or teams  
 • Resource collection ready: Alert when resources are available  
 • Progress milestones: Highlight new levels or achievements  
  
3. Best times to send notifications:  
 • Morning (7:00–9:00): Game reminders, team updates  
 • Midday (9:00–12:00): Resource updates, rewards  
 • Evening (18:00–20:00): Event pushes, offer reminders  
  
4. Tips to keep players engaged:  
 • Be concise: Short, action-focused messages  
 • Incentivize: Highlight rewards and progress  
 • Personalize: Use player names and in-game activity  
 • Time it right: Avoid sending too many or off-peak hours  
  
5. Avoid these common pitfalls:  
 • Overloading notifications → Annoying players  
 • Irrelevant messaging → Misaligned context  
 • Poor timing → Missing engagement opportunities  
  
Push notifications aren’t just reminders.  
  
They’re a strategy to re-engage, build urgency, and connect with players.
