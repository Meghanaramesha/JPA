# The real difference between good and bad games?

###### The real difference between good and bad games:

(spoiler: it’s not fancy graphics)  
It’s not deep storylines or complex mechanics either.  
  
It’s this:  
  
 • You want TO BE in a good game even with no clear goal.  
 • You’ll run, jump, shoot, fly just because it feels good.  
  
There’s a name for this:  
  
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗼𝘆 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁.  
  
 • A “toy” is fun without rules (unlike “game”).   
 • No objectives needed.  
 • It’s enjoyable just to mess with.  
 • The best games feel like that.  
  
Great games do this well:  
  
• Web-swinging in Spider-Man: smooth, fast, satisfying  
• The “pop” in Candy Crush: instant, clear feedback  
• Exploring towns in Skyrim: immersive, curiosity-driven  
• Cutting fruit in Fruit Ninja: simple, endless joy  
• Drifting in Mario Kart: movement that makes you smile  
  
All of these feel great without needing a mission.  
  
On the flip side?  
  
Bad games try to mask boring interactions with busywork:  
  
 • Rigid mechanics  
• Slow or dull feedback  
• Overly complex systems  
• Repetitive actions  
  
But if the basics aren’t fun, the rest doesn’t matter.  
  
So here’s the takeaway for developers:  
  
Build the toy first.  
Make it satisfying to  
Just play.  
  
Then, build the game around it.
