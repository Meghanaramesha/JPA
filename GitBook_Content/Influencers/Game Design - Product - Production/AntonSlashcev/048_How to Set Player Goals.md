###### 

Clear goals are crucial for retention and a sense of progress.

Here is how to build them:  
  
🔮 𝟭. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗲  
• What is the core fantasy?  
• What mastery are you selling?  
• This is the player’s main motivation.  
• It must be clear from the start.  
  
🗺️ 𝟮. 𝗠𝗮𝗽 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀  
• Tie clear verbs to outcomes.  
• Focus on winning, losing, progressing.  
• Actions must feel meaningful.  
• These are the building blocks of goals.  
  
📈 𝟯. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹 𝗟𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗿  
• Micro goals (1-5 minutes).  
• Mid goals (daily / weekly).  
• Macro goals (seasonal).  
• This creates short and long-term hooks.  
  
🎁 𝟰. 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀  
• Reward with power, options, or status.  
• Never reward with only currency.  
• Make the reward feel earned.  
• It should be proportional to the effort.  
  
📊 𝟱. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀  
• Always show the player “what’s next”.  
• Provide a clear ETA for completion.  
• Progress must be visible between sessions.  
• This helps players plan their time.  
  
🛠️ 𝟲. 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 & 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲  
• Track goal completion rates.  
• Identify and kill noisy goals.  
• Amplify the sticky, engaging ones.  
• Use data to constantly refine the system.
