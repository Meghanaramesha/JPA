# Most Game Tutorials Suck

**But why?**  
  
Because they feel like boring homework instead of an adventure.

* Limiting the player’s freedom
* Making you do obvious things
* Requiring reading lots of dull text
* Nullifying challenge, excitement, and the sense of flow

Yet, players still need the necessary context to understand the rules, objectives, and controls.  
  
**So how do you do it right?**  
  
Here are the key principles for creating effective tutorials:  
  
**1. Teach through gameplay 🎮**  
Let players learn by doing and experimenting.  
  
**2. Use visuals 🖼**  
Arrows, interface elements, and lighting work better than walls of text.  
  
**3. Minimize tutorial steps 🕒**  
Keep it short and engaging.  
  
**4. Avoid “hard” tutorials  🔓**  
Don’t lock controls unless it’s absolutely necessary.  
  
**5. Skip the obvious 🤔**  
Don’t teach what players already know (familiar controls, or tutorials for features the player has already seen).  
  
**6. Make actions intuitive 🧠**  
Ensure the required actions are naturally understandable during the tutorial.  
  
*By following these principles, you can create tutorials that are fun, engaging, and effective.*
