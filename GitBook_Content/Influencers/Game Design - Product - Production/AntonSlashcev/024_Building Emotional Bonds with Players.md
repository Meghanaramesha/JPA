###### 

Just made a guide on how you can make players truly care about your game.  
  
𝟭. Core Principles ❤️  
• Let players express their identity.  
• Through looks, loadouts, and titles.  
• The world remembers player choices.  
• Actions should have lasting outcomes.  
• Choices should have real meaning.  
  
𝟮. Ownership & Attachment 🏅  
• Allow early customization.  
• Within the first 10 minutes.  
• Let players name things.  
• Named items become cherished items.  
• Use persistent artifacts like trophies.  
  
𝟯. Micro-Narratives That Stick ✨  
• Design short session arcs.  
• Setup, challenge, payoff in 10-20 min.  
• NPCs should remember player deeds.  
• Use recurring music and motifs.  
• Create moments of surprise generosity.  
  
𝟰. Social Glue 🤝  
• Implement co-op goals.  
• Use shared meters and team streaks.  
• Give players status signals.  
• Like badges, base visits, replays.  
• Foster respectful competition.
