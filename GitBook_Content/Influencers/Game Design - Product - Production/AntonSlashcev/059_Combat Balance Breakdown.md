One tweak can break the entire player experience, or make it unforgettable.  
  
Here’s what we look at when balancing combat:  
  
𝟭) 🧍 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀  
• Speed, acceleration, and stamina/mana  
• HP and regeneration  
• Dodge chance, jump height, parry windows  
• Class or race attributes  
  
𝟮) ⚔️ 𝗪𝗲𝗮𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀  
• Damage, range, and rate of fire  
• AoE radius, bullet speed, spread  
• Projectile arc, reload speed, recoil  
• Crit chance and cost  
  
𝟯) ✨ 𝗔𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 & 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀  
• Damage/heal values and cooldowns  
• Buff/debuff durations  
• Energy costs, AoE radius, skill synergy  
  
𝟰) 🛡️ 𝗔𝗿𝗺𝗼𝗿  
• Damage reduction and weight  
• Upgrade slots and repair costs  
• Elemental resistances  
• Mobility trade-offs and stat requirements  
  
𝟱) 💀 𝗘𝗻𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗲𝘀  
• Spawn density and enemy types  
• Stats, size, and aggression radius  
• Hitboxes, weak spots, and reward drops  
  
𝟲) 🎁 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 & 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝘂𝗽𝘀  
a) 🎯 Types & Effects  
• Speed boost, XP boost, damage boost  
• Resource gain, defense buff  
  
b) 🛒 Acquisition  
• Crafting, store purchase, loot drop  
• Event rewards  
  
c) ⏳ Duration & Usage  
• Timed buffs, single-use  
• Stackable effects?  
  
Good combat balance doesn’t mean everything is equal.  
It means everything is intentional.
