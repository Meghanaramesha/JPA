#### Homescapes Level Design Insights

𝟭. 𝗠𝗮𝗽 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗼𝘂𝘁 🗺️   
 • Straight 100-level progression  
 • New rooms open at Lv 1, 2, 3, 4, 42  
 • Event layers added at Lv 26, 36  
  
𝟮. 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰𝘀 🧩  
 • 7 new blocks (Lv 8, 18, 22, 32, 35, 51, 92)  
 • 4 new elements (Lv 6, 12, 41, 71)  
 • 4 boosters (Lv 7, 14, 19, 29)  
 • 2 event rules (Lv 26, 36)  
 • 2 one-shot win levels (Lv 82, 93)  
  
𝟯. 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘆 𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀 💀  
 • Normal: ~1.1–1.4 attempts, 12–20 moves  
 • 10 hard levels (Lv 37, 45, 50, 54, 64, 75, 85, 98)  
 – Avg 1.8 attempts, ~17 moves  
 • 6 super-hard peaks (Lv 67, 69, 80, 88, 95)  
 – Avg 2.3–2.6 attempts  
 – Example: Lv 95 → 2.55 attempts / 14 moves  
  
𝟰. 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆 ⏳  
 • Early (Lv 1–20): 14–33 moves  
 • Mid (Lv 21–60): 12–20 moves  
 • Late (Lv 61–100): 12–18 moves  
 → Move compression builds tension gradually  
  
𝟱. 𝗥𝗵𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗺 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝗲𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁  
 • New mechanic drop  
 • 2–3 learning boards  
 • Hard spike  
 • Super-hard crescendo (later stages)  
 • Occasionally one-shot levels for surprise challenge  
  
𝟲. 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀 🎯  
 • New content every 10–15 levels keeps curiosity alive  
 • Predictable rhythm of spikes and breathers avoids frustration  
 • Hard and super-hard levels create mastery moments  
 • One-shot wins break tension and deliver joy  
  
The design is a loop: teach → test → spike → reward.  
  
That cycle is what keeps players coming back.
