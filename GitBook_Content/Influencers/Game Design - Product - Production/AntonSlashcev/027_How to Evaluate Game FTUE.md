Breaking down how to evaluate your game’s FTUE:  
  
𝟭. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 🎮  
  
𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:  
• Start with a clean install and record 20-40 minutes.  
• Note the hook, emotions, surprise, and confusion.  
• Log any “I wanted to…” moments or blockers.  
  
𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:  
• Do I like this moment? Why?  
• Is the goal crystal clear?  
• Do the controls feel natural and responsive?  
• Is failure fair and teachy, or just punishing?  
  
𝟮. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗲𝗿 🧠  
  
𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹 & 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴:  
• Map the user funnel: install → first tap → first win.  
• Analyze the core loop and progression.  
• Check the pacing of currencies, resources, and unlocks.  
  
𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲:  
• Evaluate the tutorial style: hard vs soft, gating.  
• Check readability: UI cues, VFX/SFX, feedback clarity.  
• Assess UI states: empty, error, next-step guidance.  
  
𝟯. 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀’ 𝗙𝗧𝗨𝗘 🕵️  
  
𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀:  
• Pick 3-5 top subgenre comparable games.  
• Run “player first, designer second” passes on them.  
• Use a standard scorecard for hook, clarity, and session length.  
  
𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀:  
• Chart the reveal order: core loop → USP → meta → shop.  
• Log friction like forced taps, waits, and paywalls.  
• Capture first asks: rate, push, account, currency.  
  
𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗲 & 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 📊  
  
𝗦𝘆𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀:  
• Merge the player diary and designer notes into one doc.  
• Build a first-session funnel with timestamps and clicks.  
  
𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:  
• Draft fixes: cut steps, embed teaching, reward action.  
• Close the loop with usability tests and store review mining.
