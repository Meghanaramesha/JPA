###### From Hyper to Hybrid Casual: The Mob Control Playbook

I partnered with [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) to analyze the evolution of Mob Control.  
  
In 2021, Mob Control was a typical hyper-casual game.   
↳ Simple mechanics.   
↳ Minimal progression.   
↳ Ad-heavy monetization.   
  
Revenue? $10K in monthly IAP.   
  
Fast forward to 2024, it’s a top hybrid-casual game.   
→ Now pulling in $2.5M per month.   
  
Here’s how they made the leap:   
  
1. Production Quality  
2021: Generic, low-quality visuals.   
2024: Polished, unique assets with smooth UI and engaging effects.   
  
2. Gameplay Depth  
2021: Fun core mechanic but repetitive.   
2024: New elements and modes introduced gradually. The game stays fresh and engaging.   
  
3. Live Ops   
2021: No live events.   
2024: Tournaments, seasonal events, and big IP collabs (e.g., Transformers).   
  
4. Meta & Progression   
2021: Basic upgrades with minimal impact.   
2024: Deep progression systems. Unit upgrades, abilities, and meaningful choices bring mid-core depth.   
  
5. Monetization  
2021: Overloaded with ads.   
2024: Balanced hybrid monetization. Rewarded ads + IAP tied to meaningful progression.   
  
2021: $10K/month.   
2024: $2.5M/month.   
  
→ More engaging gameplay.   
→ Deepened Progression  
→ Smarter monetization.   
  
This is the power of hybrid-casual.
