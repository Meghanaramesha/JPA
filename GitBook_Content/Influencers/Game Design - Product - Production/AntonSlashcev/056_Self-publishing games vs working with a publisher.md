Should you self-publish your game or work with a publisher?  
  
Both paths can lead to success, but they come with very different trade-offs.

#### 𝗣𝗨𝗕𝗟𝗜𝗦𝗛𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗪𝗜𝗧𝗛 𝗔 𝗣𝗨𝗕𝗟𝗜𝗦𝗛𝗘𝗥

✅ Upfront funding reduces your financial risk  
✅ Access to expert marketing and distribution teams  
✅ Industry connections for better visibility  
✅ Help with QA, localization, and compliance  
  
❌ You’ll give up a large share of revenue  
❌ Less control over your creative vision  
❌ Pressure to hit milestones can hurt quality  
❌ You may not retain IP ownership

#### 𝗦𝗘𝗟𝗙-𝗣𝗨𝗕𝗟𝗜𝗦𝗛𝗜𝗡𝗚

✅ You keep 100% of your game revenue  
✅ Full creative freedom from day one  
✅ Build stronger connections with your players  
✅ You can pivot faster without external pressure  
  
❌ Higher upfront costs and personal financial risk  
❌ Tougher marketing without a network  
❌ Limited resources for things like QA and localization  
❌ Everything — from success to failure — is on you  
  
*So which path is right for you?*  
𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗳:  
• You need funding and marketing expertise  
• You want to reduce risk  
• You’re okay with less creative control  
  
𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳-𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗳:  
• You’ve got the funds or a proven track record  
• Creative control and brand ownership matter most  
• Your team can handle marketing and distribution  
  
Neither path is easy.   
But knowing your priorities helps you make the right bet.
