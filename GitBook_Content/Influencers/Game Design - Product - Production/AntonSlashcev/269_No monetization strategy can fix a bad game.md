# No monetization strategy can fix a bad game.

No monetization strategy can fix a bad game.

A studio once approached me for advice on doubling their LTV.

My first question: How’s your game’s long-term retention?

I explained:  
↳ To see such growth, you’ll need to improve the game first  
↳ Boost engagement, and offer more value to players  
↳ Then, you can focus on monetization

Their response?

→ ‘We don’t want to change the game much or invest resources.  
That’s why we brought in top Advisors!’

I politely declined.

Even the best Advisors can’t perform miracles.  
Monetization is not a magic pill for poor retention or low engagement.

You want to significantly improve your LTV?  
First, you must significantly improve your game.

P.S. A year later, after multiple failed attempts to scale, that studio ended up redesigning the game from scratch.
