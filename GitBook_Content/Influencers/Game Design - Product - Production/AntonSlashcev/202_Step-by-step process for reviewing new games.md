# Step-by-step process for reviewing new games

###### I’ve reviewed over 100 games in the past few years.

Here’s my step-by-step process for reviewing a new game:  
  
𝟭. 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗘𝗔𝗥𝗖𝗛 𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗣𝗘𝗧𝗜𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗦 𝗙𝗜𝗥𝗦𝗧  
 Before playing, I focus on understanding the competition:  
 • Read user reviews in app stores  
 • Play 3-5 competitor games  
 • Take screenshots of key moments  
 • 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘇𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗮𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀:  
 —— Gameplay tempo – is it fast or slow?  
 —— Monetization strategies – how are purchases introduced?  
 —— Engagement hooks – what makes players return?  
 —— Strengths and weaknesses  
  
𝟮. 𝗣𝗟𝗔𝗬 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘 𝗧𝗪𝗜𝗖𝗘  
 Each playthrough serves a specific purpose:  
  
𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 (𝟭 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿) – Focus on the big picture:  
 • General feel – Does it engage from the start?  
 • User flow – How intuitive is it for a new player?  
 • Core loop – Do main mechanics fit together?  
 • Goals – Are short- and long-term objectives clear?  
 • Progression – Is there a sense of steady improvement?  
 • Gameplay tempo – Fast or too slow?  
 • Monetization – Do I want to pay and why?  
  
𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 (𝟮 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀) – Dive deeper:  
 • Onboarding – Is the tutorial clear?  
 • Game mechanics – Do they evolve or get repetitive?  
 • Boosters – Impactful yet balanced?  
 • Level design – Does it introduce new challenges?  
 • Art and UI – Consistent and intuitive?  
 • Monetization – When offers and ads appear? What do they offer?  
 • Game balance – Fair resource flow?  
 • Technical aspects – Bugs or glitches?  
 • Social mechanics – Are they well-integrated?  
 • Narrative – Is it interesting and well-paced?  
 • Live operations – Which events and tasks appear, and when?  
  
→ Throughout both sessions, I take detailed screenshots.  
→ I also read user reviews here to confirm my impressions.  
  
𝟯. 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗟𝗬𝗭𝗘 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘 𝗠𝗘𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗖𝗦  
 Once the playthroughs are done, I review key metrics:  
  
• Retention  
 ↳ How well does the game retain players (Day 1, Day 7, etc.)?  
  
 • Engagement  
 ↳ Average playtime, daily levels completed  
  
 • Onboarding completion  
 ↳ Tutorial completion rate  
  
 • Level funnel and churn  
 ↳ Points where players quit  
  
 • Monetization  
 ↳ How is revenue split between IAP and ads? The distribution between sources?  
  
 • Difficulty  
 ↳ Win Rate, game difficulty  
  
 • Game balance  
 ↳ Currency sources and sinks  
  
This data shows if the game meets benchmarks or needs changes.  
  
𝟰. 𝗗𝗘𝗟𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗥 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗨𝗖𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗘𝗗 𝗙𝗘𝗘𝗗𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞  
 • No vague comments like “the game is too easy.”  
 ↳ Instead, explain why it feels easy, e.g. “𝘗𝘭𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳𝘴 𝘤𝘢𝘯 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘵𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘢 𝘭𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭 1 𝘸𝘦𝘢𝘱𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘥𝘦𝘧𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘮𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘵.”  
  
 • Go beyond criticism, offer solutions:  
 ↳ “𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘦 𝘢 𝘳𝘦𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 𝘮𝘦𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘤 𝘵𝘰 𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘤𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵. 𝘓𝘪𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘮𝘮𝘰 𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.”  
  
 • Provide examples from competitors  
  
 • Prioritize feedback by urgency, attach screenshots  
 ↳ Helps developers have a clear roadmap
