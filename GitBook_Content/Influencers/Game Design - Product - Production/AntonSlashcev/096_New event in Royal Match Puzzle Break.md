New event in Royal Match: Puzzle Break

Based on Playliner research, here’s how it works:  
  
• You get 3 days to complete 5 jigsaw puzzles.  
• Each puzzle gets bigger (9 → 16 → 25 pieces).  
• Each piece costs 1 point to place, even wrong guesses.  
• Points come from beating levels, with bonuses from events like Train Journey.  
  
Start with 1 free point. After that, grind your way through the main levels to earn more.  
  
Progress looks like this:  
  
• Picture 1: 9 pieces → Easy  
• Picture 5: 25 pieces, 3 pre-placed → Not so easy  
  
Finish a picture, and you unlock a reward chest:  
  
• Boosters  
• Coins  
• Card packs  
• Tokens for other events  
  
Complete all 5 puzzles? You unlock the grand prize 🏆  
  
On average, you’ll need about 53 levels to clear the entire event.  
  
So it’s short. Strategic. And pretty satisfying to finish.  
  
Smart addition to Royal Match’s live-ops.   
Keeps the core loop fresh without overwhelming the player.
