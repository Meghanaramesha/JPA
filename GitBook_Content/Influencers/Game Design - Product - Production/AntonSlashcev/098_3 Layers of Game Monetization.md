Monetization done right starts at the core.

1️⃣ 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽  
• Core actions & goals  
• Rewards & obstacles  
• Resource flow (taps & sinks)  
  
2️⃣ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲  
• Difficulty curve & player leveling  
• Power scaling & content unlocks  
• Economy stability & boosters  
• Skill progression & feedback loops  
  
3️⃣ 𝗢𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝘀 & 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀  
• Offer frequency & pricing strategy  
• Personalization & perceived value  
• Timing, placement & FOMO  
• Conversion optimization & visual presentation  
  
Start by building a solid, engaging core gameplay loop. Then focus on progression and balance.  
  
Monetization should enhance the experience, not drive it.  
  
Get your priorities right to succeed in the long run.
