###### Solo Tournaments Guide

Here’s how they work, based on the [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) breakdown of Match Factory tournaments:  
  
𝟭. 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸  
 • Players qualify by completing at least one level.   
 • Inactive players are excluded, and everyone begins on equal ground.   
  
𝟮. 𝗪𝗶𝗻 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀  
 • Win a level on the first try? Your event token multiplier increases.   
 • Fail? The multiplier resets, adding stakes to every move.   
  
𝟯. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴  
 • Players are grouped into pools of 30–50, matched by activity or spending habits.   
 • Bots may fill gaps, keeping the competition alive.   
  
𝟰. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝘀  
 • Event tokens come from core gameplay:   
 — Completing levels   
 — Collecting special items   
 • More tokens = higher leaderboard rankings.   
  
𝟱. 𝗗𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻  
 • Tournaments run for 1–3 days, with a visible countdown timer to maintain urgency.   
  
𝟲. 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀  
 • Tiered prizes motivate participation:   
 — Top 3: Exclusive items or premium currency.   
 — Top 10: Boosters and standard rewards.   
 — Top 50: Consolation prizes to keep players engaged.   
  
𝟳. 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀  
 • Real-time leaderboard updates and notifications.   
 • Rankings displayed prominently on the main menu.   
 • Anti-cheat systems ensure fairness and build trust.   
  
This formula combines progression, competition, and meaningful rewards to keep players coming back.
