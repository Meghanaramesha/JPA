# Desire Beats Pain In Game Monetization

##### Many game designers think the key to successful monetization is creating pain points for players.

But this often leads to mediocre conversion rates and significant churns.  
  
**Why?**  
  
Because Pain points give players two options to relieve the pain:  
  
**1. Pay  
2. Close the game**  
  
And many will choose to close.  
  
A more effective strategy is to create Desire:  
Make players really want something that requires a purchase.  
  
Desire also causes a form of Pain—the Pain of not having what they want.  
  
**But there’s a crucial difference:**  
– Pain points offer two choices to relieve the pain: pay or leave  
– Desire offers only one: obtain the Desired item  
  
This way, players feel like they’re making their own decisions and getting extra value for their money.  
  
**In the “carrot and stick” system, the carrot always wins.  
  
Desire > Pain**
