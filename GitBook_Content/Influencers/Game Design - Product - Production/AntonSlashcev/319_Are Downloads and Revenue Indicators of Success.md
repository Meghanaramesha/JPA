# Are Downloads and Revenue Indicators of Success?

**Downloads and revenue are not indicators of a game’s success.**  
Many large games operate with a negative ROAS throughout their existence.  
Despite impressive numbers, they often bring their owners nothing but losses.  
  
So why do studios continue to buy traffic for such games and lose money?  
  
**Here are several reasons:**  
• Hope for profitability: Belief in a turnaround during the live-ops phase  
• Competitive strategy: Securing traffic share to force competitors to bid higher.  
• Inflating valuation: Boosting overall ARR before selling the company.  
• Attracting investments: Demonstrating potential to draw in investors.  
• Misjudgment: Sometimes, it’s simply foolishness. 🙂  
  
*There are rare cases where buying traffic for a loss-making game makes sense.*  
But it’s mostly an attempt to create the illusion of a successful game for investors or stakeholders.  
  
**Profit > Volume**
