When analyzing your game’s economy, use these angles:  
  
𝟭. 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘁 💰  
→ The price of a single item.  
  
𝟮. 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼 📈  
→ Extra value provided by bundles compared to buying single items.  
  
𝟯. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 🔄  
→ Pricing items based on another item’s cost.  
  
Let’s see this with an example from Color Block Jam:  
  
• 𝗖𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘀 💸  
→ Base price: 1,000 coins = $1.99; 100 coins = $0.2  
→ Bigger packs = better value  
→ 100,000 coins at $99.99 offers 199% extra value!  
  
• 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 🚀  
→ Time Freeze: $0.60 each  
→ Rocket: $0.93 each  
→ Hammer: $2.80 each  
→ Color Vacuum: $3.80 each  
  
• 𝗟𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 ❤️  
→ 5-life refill: $1.80 total ($0.36 per life)  
  
• 𝗕𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀 🎁  
→ Small bundle: 138% value  
→ Medium bundle: 235% value  
→ Large bundle: 287% value  
  
• 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗢𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝘀 ⚡  
→ Fail offer: 219% value  
→ No-Ads bundle: 281% value  
  
Bottom line:
