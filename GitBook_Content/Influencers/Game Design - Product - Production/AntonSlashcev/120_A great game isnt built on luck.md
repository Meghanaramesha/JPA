#### A great game isn’t built on luck.

It’s built on a blueprint.  
  
Here’s the blueprint every successful game follows 👇  
  
🎯 𝗛𝗼𝗼𝗸  
 • Grab attention fast.  
 • Make your unique value obvious from the first second.  
  
📊 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮  
 • Study your players, the market, and your competition.  
 • Track feedback and key metrics constantly.  
  
🎮 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆  
 • Fun, focused mechanics.  
 • A clear core loop and meaningful goals.  
  
🎨 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀  
 • Give your game a distinct style.  
 • Add polish and juicy feedback players can \*feel\*.  
  
👀 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸  
 • Watch how players behave — not just what they say.  
 • Real insights live in the data.  
  
📈 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻  
 • Design satisfying unlocks and upgrades.  
 • Build a smooth and motivating challenge curve.  
  
🏆 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗮  
 • Go beyond moment-to-moment play.

Every hit game gets these right.  
Miss one, and players feel it.
