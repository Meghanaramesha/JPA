# Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Mobile Game Marketing

###### In a struggling market for performance marketing, mobile developers are increasingly exploring diverse promotional strategies for their games.

**🔍 Let’s break down what mobile game marketing consists of.**  
Broadly, there are 2 sources of traffic for games:  
  
1. Organic Traffic: Players find your app in the store on their own 🌱  
2. Paid Traffic: Players click on an ad and go to the app page in the store 💸  
  
*What drives Organic and Paid traffic?*  
  
————————————————————————————  
  
**Paid Traffic is influenced by four main factors:**  
  
1. CVR (Conversion Rate): Measures the percentage of users who install the game after viewing the store page 📈  
2. CTR (Click-Through Rate): Indicates the percentage of people who click on an ad after seeing it 👀  
3. CPM (Cost Per Mille): Represents the cost of 1,000 ad impressions 💰  
4. UA Settings like target audience, network channel, geo, etc.🛠️  
  
————————————————————————————  
  
**Organic Traffic comes from either search results in the store or featuring the app in the store.**  
**Key factors for visibility in store search include:**  
> Well-known brands or IPs (e.g., Marvel, Monopoly, Fallout) 🌟  
> Game virality and blogger promotions (Among Us) 📣  
> Effective ASO optimization (when a player searches not specifically for your game but something like “action-adventure”) 🎮  
> A strong community and PR (shoutout to Supercell with their Squad Busters) 🤝  
> Classic advertising on TV and other media (like Merge Mansion with Pedro Pascal) 📺  
  
————————————————————————————  
  
**Store featuring is a distinct decision by Stores but is often influenced by:**  
> High game quality and product value 🏆  
> A strong community and brand 🔗  
> Your charismatic bizdev 🙂  
  
Organic Traffic benefits indirectly from high volumes of Paid Traffic (helping the game climb top rankings, making it more visible in search results).  
  
Both traffic types are influenced by the CVR parameter – how your store page is designed, the game’s icon, screenshots, etc.  
  
————————————————————————————  
  
**Together, organic and paid traffic determine your eCPI 📊**(Effective Cost Per Install; eCPI = total ad spend / total installs)  
  
Accounting for eCPI allows you to successfully generate traffic even for games that cannot purchase paid traffic with a positive ROAS.  
  
Therefore, it is important to adhere to a comprehensive approach to marketing and use all available tools to promote the game. 🌟
