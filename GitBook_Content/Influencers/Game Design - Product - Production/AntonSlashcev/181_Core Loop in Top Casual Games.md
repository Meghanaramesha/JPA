###### Core Loop in Top Casual Games

Analyzed the main gameplay loop of several games:  
  
– Homescapes  
– Monopoly GO  
– Royal Match  
– Match Factory  
– Coin Master  
– Travel Town  
  
The most interesting observation is that the live ops of top games are deeply integrated into the gameplay loop, becoming an essential part of it rather than a separate activity.
