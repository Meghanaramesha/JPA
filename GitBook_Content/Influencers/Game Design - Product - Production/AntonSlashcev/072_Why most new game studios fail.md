# Why most new game studios fail.

###### Why most new game studios fail:

• Overpay big-name hires  
• Build in a bubble for years  
• Blow cash on fancy offices  
• Make big promises, ship nothing  
• Trust your “gut instinct” over research  
• Obsess over famous logos, not gameplay  
• Add a bunch of useless features no one asked  
• Skip player testing because “we just know it’s fun”  
• Launch the game to zero buzz & burn money on fake hype  
• Run out of money -> shut down, blame bad luck, market, players  
  
How new studios actually win:  
  
• Study the market, know your strengths & weaknesses  
• Stay small, keep burn & size low, survive longer  
• Find a niche where you can be the best  
• Obsess over early players feedback  
• Hire for great skills, not big names  
• Go remote-first, be scrappy  
• Launch a tiny, fun version  
• Grow slowly  
  
No magic.  
Just brutal focus and player-first execution.
