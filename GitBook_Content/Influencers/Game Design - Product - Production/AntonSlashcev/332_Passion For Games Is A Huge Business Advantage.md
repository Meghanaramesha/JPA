# Passion For Games Is A Huge Business Advantage

##### **Why?**

**1. Passion = Knowledge**  
Ever met someone who lights up when discussing a topic?  
They can talk for hours, knowing every tiny detail.  
  
This deep immersion can’t be faked—it’s driven by passion.  
  
**2. Passion = Understanding the Audience**  
If you love the games you make, you know exactly what your audience wants  
  
Because you are the audience!  
  
**3. Passion = High Product Value**  
Passionate creators can’t tolerate mediocrity.  
  
They strive to enhance every aspect of the game, adding interesting details and putting their soul into the project.  
  
Players notice this dedication.  
  
**4. Passion = Going the Extra Mile**  
Every project faces tough moments.  
In these times, the willingness to go the extra mile is crucial.  
  
**Those who don’t care will give up.**  
*Those who love the game will find creative solutions to succeed.*  
Of course, other qualities are essential in game development.  
  
Game design, business skills, management, strategy, etc. All are critical.  
  
**But a love for games is just as important, especially for leaders.  
It’s the foundation on which everything else is built.**  
  
So yes, loving the games you make isn’t just good for you.  
It’s also great for business and your team.
