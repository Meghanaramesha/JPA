# What makes movement in games feel fast?

What makes movement in games feel fast?  
  
(spoiler: it’s not the speed parameter)  
  
It’s the little details that create the feeling of velocity:  
  
1. Camera Angle & FOV  
↳ Lowering the camera and increasing FOV heightens the sense of motion.  
  
2. VFX & Particles  
↳ Dust, engine smoke, and wind particles enhance the illusion of speed.  
  
3. Blur & Vignette  
↳ Edge blur and a slight vignette immerse players more deeply.  
  
4. Camera Shake  
↳ A small shake adds intensity, but be careful not to overdo it.  
  
5. Sound Effects  
↳ The roar of an engine or rushing wind can make the experience more convincing than visuals alone.  
  
These small tweaks make a game feel faster without changing the speed.
