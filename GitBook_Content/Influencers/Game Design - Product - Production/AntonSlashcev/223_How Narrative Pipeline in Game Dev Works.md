###### As a Narrative Producer, I was responsible for a narrative of a dozen games.

Here’s how the narrative pipeline in game development works:  
  
1 🎮 Start with the Game Concept  
 • Define the genre, platforms, target audience, and core mechanics.  
 • Establish the unique selling points (USPs) and the game loop.  
  
2 📖 Develop the Synopsis  
 • Create a brief overview of the story (1-2 pages).  
 • Use a three-act structure to outline the main plot, characters, and story arc.  
  
3 💡 Write the Logline  
 • Condense the story into 2-3 sentences.  
 • Highlight the protagonist, goal, and conflict.  
  
4 🌍 Dive into Worldbuilding  
 • Design the game’s setting.  
 • Focus on elements that shape the story, characters, and gameplay.  
  
5 👤 Character Passports & Speech  
 • Define character backstories, motivations, and traits.  
 • Develop unique speech patterns and sample dialogue.  
  
6 🗺️ Build a Story Outline  
 • Break down the narrative into acts and chapters.  
 • Highlight key events, twists, and character development.  
  
7 📊 Create a Chapters Flowchart  
 • Map branching paths, player decisions, and outcomes.  
 • Integrate game mechanics into the story progression.  
  
8 🎨 Describe the Art  
 • Provide references for character designs, environments, and key scenes.  
  
9 🔧 Highlight Narrative Features  
 • Outline tools like branching dialogue or interactive storytelling.  
  
10 🗨️ Write the Dialogue  
 • Craft engaging, character-driven dialogue.  
 • Define cut scenes and character actions.  
  
11 🕵️ Add Secondary Narrative Layers  
 • Include lore, item descriptions, and environmental storytelling.  
  
12 🎙️ Voice Acting & Motion Capture  
 • Cast and record voices; enhance animations through motion capture.  
  
13 🔗 Integrate the Narrative  
 • Implement the narrative content into the game.  
  
14 🛠️ Test & Iterate  
 • Playtest, gather feedback, and refine the narrative.  
  
15 🌍 Localize for Global Players  
 • Adapt the story for different languages and cultures.
