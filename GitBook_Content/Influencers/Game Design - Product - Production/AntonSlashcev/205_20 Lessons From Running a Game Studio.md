###### 20 Lessons From Running a Game Studio

Here’s what Mykola and I learned after years of running game studios:  
  
1. Focus beats headcount  
 ↳ A small, sharp team > a large, distracted one.  
  
2. Passion drives the business, but discipline sustains it  
 ↳ Passion starts things, but discipline keeps them running.  
  
3. Something will always go wrong  
 ↳ Plans fail. Adapt quickly and keep moving forward.  
  
4. Build a culture, not just games  
 ↳ Strong culture fosters creativity and happier teams.  
  
5. Speed > quality > quantity  
 ↳ Fast iterations are great, but never sacrifice quality.  
  
6. Players are your compass  
 ↳ Listen, observe, and adapt based on their feedback.  
  
7. Build a pipeline, not a one-hit wonder  
 ↳ Create systems that let you learn, improve, and reuse.  
  
8. Partnerships are a force multiplier  
 ↳ Collaborate to unlock opportunities you can’t do alone.  
  
9. Kill your darlings  
 ↳ Let go of games that don’t meet expectations, even personal favorites.  
  
10. Good onboarding is non-negotiable  
 ↳ Smooth onboarding hooks players from the start.  
  
11. Love the games you make  
 ↳ Passion shows in the final product—players can tell.  
  
12. Timing is everything  
 ↳ Even great games fail when released at the wrong time.  
  
13. Talk to your players  
 ↳ Reviews and playtests give invaluable insights.  
  
14. Crunch culture = burnout  
 ↳ It leads to lower-quality games and exhausted teams.  
  
15. It’s a long game  
 ↳ Success takes time—patience and persistence are key.  
  
16. The market is always changing  
 ↳ Stay ahead of trends and monetization models.  
  
17. Own your failures  
 ↳ Celebrate wins, but take personal responsibility for mistakes.  
  
18. Iterate, don’t perfectionist  
 ↳ No game launches perfect. Improve continuously.  
  
19. You can’t please everyone  
 ↳ Focus on making your core audience happy.  
  
20. Network like your studio depends on it  
 ↳ Because it really does.  
  
Running a studio is tough, but these lessons make the journey smoother.
