##### I analyzed 26,191 new mobile games launched in H1 2025.

Based on [AppMagic](https://appmagic.rocks/top-charts/apps?utm_source=Gamigion) data, here is how they performed:  
  
𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘀  
• 26 191 new titles (up +50% !)  
• $1.09B IAP — just 3.5 % of total game revenue  
• 2.18 B downloads — 7.1 % of all installs  
  
𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 🤑  
• 0.5% of games cleared $1.1 M+  
• 83% earned $0  
• The odds remain brutal  
  
𝗧𝗼𝗽 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 (≥ $𝟭𝟬𝟬𝗞 / 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵)  
1. RPG — $850M | 6.5% hit rate   
  
2. Strategy — $634M | 2.9%   
  
3. Sports — $50M | 2.8 %  
  
𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 🔎  
• 0.2% of games broke 5M+ installs  
• 70% never hit even 10K downloads  
  
𝗧𝗼𝗽 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝘀 (≥ 𝟭𝟬𝟬 𝗞 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀 / 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵)  
1. Action — 310M installs | 8.3% hit rate   
  
2. Simulation — 777 M | 5.8%   
  
3. Puzzle — 858 M | 2.2%  
  
𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆  
Supply keeps soaring; breakout wins remain scarce.   
More games being released = competition is higher than ever.  
  
Nail retention, niche fit, and monetization early, or join the 83 % that make nothing.  
  
Which genre will steal the spotlight next year?
