# How To Review Game Builds Like a Pro?

**After reviewing more than 1,000 game builds I have prepared a framework for a Producer \ Creative Director \ Lead GD to review a build.**  
  
Here are the aspects to evaluate and questions to ask yourself while playing:  
  
**1. General Game Feel 😊**

* Fun: Is the game enjoyable? Why or why not?
* Engagement: Does the game make you want to play more?
* Paying Motivation: What would make you spend money in the game?
* Memorable Moments: What stands out about the game?
* Confusion: What aspects were confusing and how can they be improved?

**2. Core Gameplay 🎮**

* Basic Actions: Are the mechanics like shooting satisfying?
* Complexity & Depth: How deep are the game mechanics?
* Clarity: Are the game goals and rules easy to understand?
* Variability: Does the game offer various playstyles?
* Evolution: Do the game mechanics evolve?

**3. Art & UI 🎨**

* Visual Appeal: Does the game have a unique art style?
* Consistency: Is the visual style consistent throughout?
* UI Clarity: Is the user interface intuitive?

**4. Game Flow & Balance ⚖**

* Guidance: Does the game effectively guide the player?

* Technical Stability: Are there bugs or performance issues?
* Social Interaction: Are multiplayer elements fun and secure?
* Copyrights: Does the game infringe on any copyrights?

**7. Pro Tips for Feedback 💡**

* Play at least 2-3 times. First, get an overall impression; second, note details; third, compare with competitors.
* Rule of 100: Gather at least 100 comments for a backlog.
* Summarize: Highlight key feedback first, then detail specific comments.
* Prioritize Feedback: Rank issues by severity.
* Document for the Future: Note even what can’t currently be changed.
