###### How to Design a Core Game Loop

1️⃣ Define the core actions   
• What does the player actually do?   
• Think exploration, combat, solving puzzles, collecting resources.  
  
2️⃣ Establish clear objectives   
• Give players something to strive for   
• Short-term: complete a level   
• Mid-term: unlock a new skill   
• Long-term: reach a top rank  
  
3️⃣ Provide meaningful feedback   
• Every action should feel good   
• Use sound, visuals, and numbers to create satisfying responses   
• Feedback reinforces mastery and progress  
  
4️⃣ Balance challenge and reward   
• Too easy? Boring   
• Too hard? Frustrating   
• The sweet spot keeps players in the zone  
  
5️⃣ Structure loops by timeframe   
• Moment-to-moment: basic actions like jumping or attacking   
• Minute-to-minute: clearing a room or finishing a short quest   
• Hour-to-hour: hitting key milestones like leveling up   
• Day-to-day: daily missions, global events, long-term goals  
  
6️⃣ Add psychological retention mechanics   
• Daily login rewards   
• Win streak incentives   
• FOMO through limited-time events   
• Social features to build community  
  
A good core loop is simple.   
But building one that feels great? That’s the craft.  
  
Design it well, and your players won’t just play your game; they’ll stick around.
