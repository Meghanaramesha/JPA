# Your game features aren’t USPs.

###### Sorry, but your game features aren’t USPs.

Here’s why:   
  
𝟭. 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱   
↳ Players expect your game to have upgrades, boosters, weapons, cool graphics, etc.   
↳ A USP makes your game truly memorable – like a unique narrative or a fresh gameplay twist.   
  
𝟮. 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗲𝗱, 𝗨𝗦𝗣𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗻’𝘁   
↳ Competitors can copy features.   
↳ But a USP that evokes emotion, like excitement or nostalgia, is much harder to replicate.   
  
𝟯. 𝗨𝗦𝗣𝘀 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻   
↳ Even with similar mechanics, a strong USP positions your game as unique.   
  
𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀:   
• 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲 – More than a battle royale; it’s the only one integrating live pop culture events and collaborations.   
  
• 𝗔𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝘀 – Simple gameplay, but the USP lies in social deduction and group psychology.   
  
• 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 – Combines AAA quality with free-to-play accessibility in an open-world RPG.   
  
If you’re a producer, ask yourself:   
  
• What experience can we deliver that no one else is offering?   
• What emotion do we want players to feel?   
• How can we craft a narrative or ecosystem that’s irreplaceable?   
  
Features won’t win the game.   
A great USP will.
