𝟭. What is FUUU Factor 🧠  
• It is a measure of frustration based on near wins.  
• Formula: Attempts until first win / near-win attempts.  
• A near win is defined as a loss very close to success.  
• It happens when you are one move short.  
• It also applies if you have one objective left.  
  
𝟮. Why Use It 💰  
• It captures the perceived difficulty of a level.  
• Shows the difference between “I can do it” and “Hopeless”.  
• Helps you place blocking and relief levels effectively.  
• Supports your monetization strategy.  
• Players are more likely to spend money after near wins.  
  
𝟯. Key Aspects 📊  
• Design a spiky difficulty curve.  
• Include easy starts, hard blockers, and relief levels.  
• Provide early signals via first session losses and wins.  
• Use controlled luck mechanisms.  
• Randomness should allow comebacks, not create unwinnable states.  
  
𝟰. How to Design for FUUU 🔧  
• Instrument levels to log attempts, moves, and objectives.  
• Mark near wins clearly in your analytics.  
• Set rough bands for the metric values.  
• A score of 2-5 is the sweet spot.  
• Tune levels using levers like moves, blockers, and spawns.  
  
𝟱. Common Mistakes 💀  
• Designing every level as a blocker.  
• Focusing only on win rates and ignoring near wins.  
• Presenting offers on hopeless levels.  
• relying on pure RNG instead of controlled probability.
