# Don’t Make New Mobile Games -

**A piece of advice for new dev teams:**  
  
***Don’t make new mobile games.***  
  
Choose another platform for now (PC / UGC / Web).  
  
**Here’s why:**  
  
From a business perspective, developing new mobile games has lost its appeal over the past four years because of:  
  
**📊 Success Rate (For Experienced Teams):**  
— Then: ~1 successful game out of 10-15 projects.  
— Now: <1 successful game out of 50 projects, even for top teams. 🔽  
  
**💰 Development Costs:**  
— Then: MVP development required 5-8 experienced specialists.  
— Now: 20-30 or more for casual games. 🔼  
  
💲 Potential Profit (Revenue – UA spends): remains unchanged at best.  
  
➡ As a result, the Expected Value of prototyping has decreased. 🔻  
  
**Expected Value = (Potential Profit \* Success Rate) – Dev Costs**  
  
Even the biggest companies like Playrix and Supercell struggle to launch new games despite unlimited budgets.  
  
**What does this mean for new teams?**  
  
— The entry ticket for mobile game dev has become very expensive.  
  
— You need millions of dollars to expect your studio to survive until one of your games brings significant profit.  
  
— With current challenges in attracting venture capital, such budgets are rare, especially for newcomers.  
  
**So, I’d say that most new development teams should consider UGC platforms (Fortnite / Roblox) or PC development in the current market.**  
  
These platforms let you reach a large audience with lower marketing costs due to virality and community building. The expected value is higher.  
————————————————————————————  
  
Now, don’t get me wrong.  
**I’m not saying “mobile is dying” or anything like that.**  
  
Mobile is a huge market, it’s not going anywhere, and will evolve.  
  
And I believe many unique opportunities are emerging in 2024 in games.  
  
*Just be selective in seeking opportunities and don’t swim against the tide. 🙂*
