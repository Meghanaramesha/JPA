###### 

Just compared core features, offers, and events in Candy Crush Saga, Gardenscapes, Homescapes, Matchington Mansion, and Royal Match.   
  
**Here are universal match-3 game patterns I found:**  
🔄 Retention  
 • Comeback reward & daily bonuses bring players back  
 • Refill lives & social life exchanges strengthen bonds  
 • Rate us prompts boost app store ratings  
  
🎉 Boosters  
 • Pre-boosters set the pace before a level  
 • In-game boosters & charging boosters add strategy  
 • Post-boosters give a second chance after a fail  
  
💰 Offers  
 • One-time offer: micro-deals lasting 24 hours  
 • Offer keep playing: pops up after a level fail  
 • Rolling offer: drip mini-deals to re-engage players  
  
🎟️ Events  
 • Event pass: progress tracks with free & paid rewards  
 • Milestones: rewards for hitting progress points  
 • Win streak: bonuses for consecutive wins  
  
These mechanics drive engagement, session length, and monetization.
