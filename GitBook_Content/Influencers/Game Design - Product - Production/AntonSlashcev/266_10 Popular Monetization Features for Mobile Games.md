10 Popular Monetization Features for Mobile Games  
  
Based on the [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) research, here are the top approaches developers are using to boost revenue:  
  
1. Starter Pack   
 • A low-priced bundle ($0.99 to $9.99) offered in the first 30 minutes of gameplay.   
 • Huge discounts (50%-90%) to attract early players.  
  
2. Rolling Offer   
 • Offers with multiple deals, some free.   
 • Unlocks deals in a sequence, keeping players engaged over time.  
  
3. Build Your Offer   
 • Players choose rewards before purchasing.   
 • Option to buy the entire bundle at a discounted price.  
  
4. Choose Your Offer   
 • Multiple bundles targeting different spending cohorts, encouraging higher spending.  
  
5. Double & Triple Offers   
 • Premium bundles with currencies and boosters available in the store.   
 • Store is accessible from the beginning of the game.  
  
6. Shop Bundles   
 • Short-term offers (less than 24 hours) regularly appear in the game store.  
  
7. One-Time Offers   
 • Time-limited offers, usually after specific milestones, driving immediate purchases.  
  
8. Piggy Bank   
 • Players collect in-game currency over time and unlock contents by paying real money.  
  
9. Season Pass   
 • Players unlock rewards by completing levels and collecting event points.   
 • Includes both free and paid tiers for extra rewards.  
  
10. Subscription Models   
 • Recurring payments (weekly/monthly/yearly) to access exclusive items, faster progression, or remove ads.   
 • Auto-renewal unless canceled.  
  
These features play on psychological triggers like FOMO (fear of missing out) and offer value across different price points to drive in-game spending.
