22 Lessons Learned from Working on Billion-Dollar Games   
  
  
1. Team + Passion + Data = Success   
↳ A great product alone won’t guarantee success—it’s about leveraging data and a passionate team.  
  
2. No One Knows the Secret Sauce   
↳ Even the biggest companies can’t predict what will work; it’s always a risk filled with trial and error.  
  
3. Quality Over Quantity   
↳ One high-quality feature can make a huge impact, while many mediocre ones add little value.  
  
4. Focus Is Everything   
↳ Don’t spread your resources too thin. Focused efforts lead to better results.  
  
5. Small Teams, Big Results   
↳ Agile, smaller teams are more efficient than large, slow-moving ones.  
  
6. If You’re Small, Innovate. If You’re Big, Imitate   
↳ Big companies often stick to what’s proven, while smaller teams take the risks.  
  
7. Company Culture Is More Than Perks   
↳ Creativity and empowerment come from culture, not just free snacks and perks.  
  
8. Great Developers Are Avid Gamers   
↳ The best way to understand what works? Play lots of games.  
  
9. Many Opinions, No Absolute Truths   
↳ In game development, there’s rarely a single “right” answer.  
  
10. Bureaucracy Kills Creativity   
↳ Overcomplicating the approval process stifles innovation.  
  
11. Generosity Encourages Spending   
↳ Successful games offer plenty for free, which makes players more likely to spend.  
  
12. Player Feedback Is Gold   
↳ Your community will reveal insights that internal testing might miss.  
  
13. Failure Is Part of the Process   
↳ Not every idea will work, and that’s okay. Learn and adapt.  
  
14. Simplicity Wins   
↳ Simple and intuitive designs often appeal to the widest audience.  
  
15. Protect Your Talent   
↳ Your team is your most valuable asset—invest in their growth and well-being.  
  
16. First-Time User Experience (FTUE) Is Crucial   
↳ A smooth onboarding process is key to retaining new players.  
  
17. A/B Testing Is Your Best Friend   
↳ Testing different versions of your game can help you optimize based on real user data.  
  
18. Technical Debt Accumulates Quickly   
↳ Neglecting code quality will slow development and create long-term problems.  
  
19. Localization Is More Than Translation   
↳ Adapting content to different cultures is crucial for global success.  
  
20. Retention Beats Acquisition   
↳ Keeping your current players engaged is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
  
21. Player Trust Is Fragile   
↳ Once you lose trust, it’s incredibly hard to regain.  
  
22. Narrative Is a Powerful Tool   
↳ Even a simple, well-told story can keep players emotionally invested.
