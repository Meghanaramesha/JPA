# How to Make Players Pay in F2P games?

##### Make them feel like they DON’T need to pay.

*Be generous and patient.*  
Make your game exciting and addictive, even without spending money.  
  
There will always be players who want more. Who want to advance faster.

* Monetize this desire for something “extra”.
* Don’t hide all the fun behind a paywall.
* Offer additional value for payment.

**Consider games like Monopoly Go or Royal Match.**  
There players can enjoy the game for a long time without hitting a hard paywall or facing shortages. Free rewards are constantly showering down.  
  
**Why pay for anything in these games, you might wonder?**  
Yet, these games are among the highest earners in the world.  
  
They create great value for players upfront.  
And even non-paying players enjoy the game.  
  
**So, be generous. Be patient.**  
Ensure players don’t feel forced to pay.  
Let it be their choice because the game is cool and they want more.  
  
*You will be surprised how effective this monetization strategy can be.*
