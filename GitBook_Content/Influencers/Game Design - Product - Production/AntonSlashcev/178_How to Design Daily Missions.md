###### How to Design Daily Missions

𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 + 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀   
• Simple, straightforward tasks with quick payoffs   
• Example: “Complete 3 levels” or “Collect 10 items”   
• Immediate gratification fuels longer play sessions   
  
𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁-𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴-𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀   
• Daily missions for quick engagement   
• Tie them to weekly/monthly goals for sustained interest   
• Example: “Finish 5 daily missions in a week” to unlock exclusives   
  
𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆   
• Require real participation, not just passive logins   
• Example: “Win 5 battles” or “Use 3 different weapons”   
• Drives mastery of game mechanics   
  
𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘆   
• Simple starter tasks for newcomers   
• Gradually increase complexity for veterans   
• Keep missions challenging but fair   
  
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀   
• High spenders crave premium rewards   
• Free players lean toward resource-focused tasks   
• Aligning with preferences = stronger engagement   
  
𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸?   
• Retention: players log in daily for rewards   
• Monetization: premium rewards encourage spending   
• Engagement: goal-oriented play keeps interest high   
• Content utilization: missions showcase underused features   
  
𝗣𝗿𝗼 𝘁𝗶𝗽𝘀   
• Rotate mission types—seasonal and event-driven tasks add variety   
• Offer meaningful rewards—too little kills motivation, too much devalues progress   
• Add social elements—co-op and competitive missions build stronger communities   
  
Daily missions aren’t just checklists, they’re powerful engagement tools.
