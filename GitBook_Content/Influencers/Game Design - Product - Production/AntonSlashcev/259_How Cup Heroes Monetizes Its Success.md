Cup Heroes is a masterclass in hybrid-casual monetization.   
  
Here’s how they do it:  
  
I. Core-Gameplay Ads Monetization:  
  
• 🛡️ Watch ads to unlock skills like boosting damage or crit rate.  
>>>> Skills last for only one chapter, so players keep watching.  
• 💀 Revive your character once per chapter by watching an ad.  
• 🎁 Double your rewards at the end of each chapter with another ad.  
  
II. Progression IAP Monetization:  
  
• 🎉 Starter packs offer hard and soft currency, plus bonuses.  
• 🏆 Season passes keep players engaged with rewards and daily quests.  
• 💎 Hard currency packs let players fast-track progress for a premium price.  
• 🎲 Gacha chests offer upgrades and characters with a bit of surprise.  
• 🔓 Unlock new characters by collecting fragments or buying them with diamonds.  
  
III. Other Monetization Options:  
  
• ⚡ Speed boosts make long battles quicker.  
• 🚫 A small fee removes interstitial ads permanently for smoother gameplay.  
  
Results?  
  
• 60/40 split between in-app purchases and ads.   
• 40% Day 1 retention, 14% Day 7, 3% Day 30.   
• Average daily playtime: 54 minutes.  
  
Cup Heroes finds the perfect balance between player engagement and monetization.
