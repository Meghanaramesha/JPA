###### Want to review a new game like a pro?

𝟭. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁.   
Before diving in, understand the landscape.   
• Read user reviews in app stores   
• Play 3-5 competitor games   
• Take screenshots of key moments   
• Analyze gameplay tempo, monetization strategies, and engagement hooks   
  
𝟮. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝘄𝗶𝗰𝗲.   
  
1️⃣ 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵:   
• Does it engage from the start?   
• Is the user flow intuitive?   
• Do mechanics fit together?   
• Are objectives and progression clear?   
• Is monetization appealing or intrusive?   
  
2️⃣ 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵:   
• Is the tutorial effective?   
• Do mechanics evolve or get repetitive?   
• Are boosters balanced?   
• Does level design introduce challenges?   
• Are UI, art, and social mechanics well-integrated?   
• Are ads and offers well-placed?   
• Any bugs or glitches?   
  
𝟯. 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘇𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀.   
Once you’ve played, dig into the data.   
• Retention – Are players coming back?   
• Engagement – Daily playtime, levels completed   
• Monetization – IAP vs. ads, revenue sources   
• Onboarding – Tutorial completion rate   
• Game balance – Resource flow, difficulty, and progression   
  
𝟰. 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸.   
Avoid vague comments like “too easy.” Instead:   
• Explain why it feels easy (e.g., enemies are weak early on)   
• Offer solutions (e.g., add reload mechanics for pacing)   
• Prioritize feedback by urgency, attach screenshots   
• Provide competitor examples for reference   
  
This approach helps dev teams refine their game efficiently.
