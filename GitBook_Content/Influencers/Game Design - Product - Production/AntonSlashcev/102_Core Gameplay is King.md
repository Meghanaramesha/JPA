###### Core Gameplay is King

𝟭. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 🎮  
 • Choose one crisp verb players will repeat nonstop  
 • Make it feel fast, tactile, and satisfying even when nothing happens  
 • Start simple, then layer timing and combos later  
  
𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀:  
• Super Mario – jump / throw / capture  
• Call of Duty – aim / shoot / slide  
• Royal Match – swap / match / decorate  
  
𝟮. 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗹𝗲𝘀 ⚔️  
 • Obstacles give your verb meaning  
 • Calibrate difficulty to stay in the flow zone  
 • Telegraph danger clearly – no cheap surprises  
 • Mix soft walls (time, resources) with hard walls (bosses, skill checks)  
  
𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗹𝗲𝘀 👹  
• Time pressure  
• Enemy swarm  
• Limited lives  
• Precision jumps  
• Environmental hazards  
• Hidden info  
• Boss patterns   
  
𝟯. 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀 🥇  
  
 • Short-term (seconds–minutes): instant rewards  
👉 Coins, XP, hit flashes  
  
 • Mid-term (sessions–days): visible growth  
👉 Unlocks, new tools, new chapters  
   
 • Long-term (weeks–months): mastery  
👉 Meta goals, rankings, narrative arcs  
  
𝟰. 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽 🔁  
 • Act → Obstacle → Feedback → Reward → Upgrade  
 • Then repeat, but stronger  
  
𝟱. 𝗣𝗿𝗼 𝘁𝗶𝗽𝘀   
 • Fun is king – boring actions can’t be saved  
 • Don’t explain, show. First 30 minutes must prove the loop  
 • Add juice: screen shake, hit sounds, knockback  
 • Playtest early and often. Don’t tune before testing  
 • Spike the difficulty, then give relief: classic rise-fall  
 • Cut anything that doesn’t serve the core verb or goals  
  
If the action feels great, you’re on the right track.  
Everything else is bonus.
