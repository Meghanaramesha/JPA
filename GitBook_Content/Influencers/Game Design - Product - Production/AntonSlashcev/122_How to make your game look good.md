#### How to make your game look good?

It comes down to six key fundamentals:  
  
1. 🎥 Camera  
 A great camera is your starting point.  
 • Pick the right angles and horizon line.  
 • Highlight the most important gameplay elements.  
 • Avoid awkward, disorienting views.  
  
2. ⚫⚪ Contrast  
 Make important objects pop.  
 • Bright and dark areas should balance for clarity.  
 • Separate key objects from the background visually.  
 • Use contrast to guide the player’s attention naturally.  
  
3. 🎨 Composition  
 Lead the player’s eye where it matters.  
 • Add guiding lines to focus attention.  
 • Follow the rule of thirds for balance.  
 • Make every shot purposeful and easy to read.  
  
4. 💡 Light  
 Lighting is more than mood—it’s direction.  
 • Highlight paths and objectives with light.  
 • Use shadows and highlights for depth.  
 • Dynamic lighting can boost immersion.  
  
5. 🕺 Animation  
 Movement makes the world feel alive.  
 • Keep animations fluid and believable.  
 • Add small details like idle movements or environmental touches.  
 • Use motion to enhance gameplay clarity and character personality.  
  
6. 🌈 Color  
 Set the tone with a cohesive palette.  
 • Match colors to your world’s mood.  
 • Guide the player’s focus with intentional hues.  
 • Don’t overload: less is often more.  
  
Master these basics, and even a simple game can shine.
