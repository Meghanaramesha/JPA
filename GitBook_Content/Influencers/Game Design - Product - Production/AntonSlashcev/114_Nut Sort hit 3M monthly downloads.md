#### Nut Sort hit 3M monthly downloads.

On paper, it outperformed Magic Sort.  
  
But in reality?  
Magic Sort is miles ahead in monetization, LiveOps and player value.  
  
Here’s why download numbers don’t tell the whole story:  
  
𝟭. 𝗪𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 & 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 🎯  
  
• Nut Sort focuses on the character — not the win  
• Magic Sort makes the reward the hero  
• Magic Sort shows win streaks and completed levels  
• Nut Sort doesn’t even show the level number  
  
Players need feedback to feel progress.  
Magic Sort delivers. Nut Sort doesn’t.  
  
𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 💹  
  
• Nut Sort has no clear goals or meaningful rewards  
• Magic Sort builds momentum with regular rewards and chapter unlocks  
  
Progression drives retention.  
Without it, players drop off fast.  
  
𝟯. 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗨𝘀𝗲 💲  
  
• Nut Sort’s coins? Only for background customization  
• Magic Sort’s coins = boosters + continues  
  
Players want value from their in-game currency.  
Magic Sort gives them reasons to spend.  
  
𝟰. 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀, 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀 & 𝗟𝗼𝘀𝘀 𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 📑  
  
• Nut Sort has Daily Quests — but no real consequences  
• Magic Sort includes two types of win streaks  
• That creates strong loss aversion = better engagement  
  
No loss = no reason to care about losing.  
Magic Sort turns that into motivation.  
  
𝟱. 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 💰  
  
• Nut Sort = one VIP offer that barely converts  
• Magic Sort = multiple bundles for different player types  
• Magic Sort’s starter pack looks rich — feels valuable  
  
Even visually, Magic Sort sells better:  
“No Ads” label stands out, booster count is clear, coins included.  
  
𝟲. 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 & 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀 🔢  
  
• Nut Sort’s IAP revenue is minimal  
• Magic Sort performs on par with top casual games  
• Nut Sort has more downloads  
• Magic Sort has fewer — but much higher revenue per user  
  
—  
  
Better UX. Smarter monetization.  
Magic Sort nails what makes casual games work.  
  
Same category.  
Totally different playbook.
