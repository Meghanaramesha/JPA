# What Is The Process Of Creating a Narrative In Games?

##### Here is the pipeline I created and used when I was a Narrative Producer:

**0) Logline**— High-concept premise  
— Two or three sentences  
— Includes the protagonist, goal, and main conflict  
  
**1) Synopsis**— Brief story overview (1-2 pages)  
— Follows a three-act structure  
— Outlines main plot points, key characters, and the overall story arc  
  
**2) Story Outline**— Breakdown narrative into acts and major chapters  
— Highlight key events, character development, and plot twists  
— Roadmap for the entire story  
  
**2A) Worldbuilding**— Create the game’s setting  
— Focus on aspects that influence the story and characters  
  
**2B) Characters Passports**— Backstory and motivation  
— Key character traits  
— Role in the plot  
— Description of appearance  
— References  
  
**2C) Speech Characteristics**— Unique speech patterns for each character  
— Examples: old-fashioned or slang speech, stuttering, etc.  
— Sample of dialogue  
  
**3) Chapter Flowchart**— Visual representation of story progression  
— Detail branching paths, scenes, player decisions, and possible outcomes  
— Indicates game mechanics used in scenes  
  
**3A) Art Description**— Descriptions and references for the art team  
— Includes character designs, environments, items, and key scenes  
  
**3B) Narrative Features Description**— Tools/features for narrative  
— Dialogue system, branching path mechanics  
— Interactive storytelling elements, etc.  
  
**4) Writing Dialogue**— Create engaging dialogues fitting characters and advancing the story  
— Describe cut scenes and character actions  
  
**4A) Secondary Narrative**— Environmental storytelling  
— Lore texts  
— Item descriptions  
— Barks & optional dialogues  
  
**5) Voice Acting & Motion Capture**— Casting and recording voice actors  
— Motion capture to enhance character animations (if required)  
  
**6) Integration**— Implement and configure created narrative content into the game build  
— Creating cutscenes  
  
**7) Testing and Iteration**— Playtest, gather feedback, and iterate  
— Improve pacing, engagement, and coherence with gameplay  
  
**8) Localization**— Translate and adapt the narrative for different languages and cultures  
— Ensure the main narrative is tested and approved
