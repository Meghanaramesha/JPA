###### 

A framework for making tough decisions on your game project.  
  
𝟭. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲   
• Iterate when the core loop works, but KPIs miss the mark.  
• Pivot with a mechanic or audience mismatch.  
• Only if market fit still seems plausible.  
• Kill if fun, retention, and monetization are all flat.  
• This is after multiple repeated tests.  
  
𝟮. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽 🔄  
• Capture: Ship your build, then log every single KPI.  
• Analyze: Compare your metrics vs. market benchmarks.  
• Hypothesize: Create one clear, testable fix per pain point.  
• Execute: Run the test and get fresh data.  
• Commit: Choose to Iterate, Pivot, or Kill based on evidence.  
  
𝟯. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰-𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗚𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲 🚦  
• Green (Iterate): KPIs are steady, team energy is high.  
• D1 > 35%, D7 > 10%.  
• Yellow (Pivot): KPIs are mixed, team energy is medium.  
• D1 > 30%, D7 > 7%.  
• Red (Kill): KPIs are flat, team energy is low.  
• D1 < 30%, D7 < 5%.  
  
𝟰. 𝗙𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗘𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 ✅  
• Is D1/D7 retention over 35% / 15%?  
• Is average session length growing week-on-week?  
• Does LTV beat CPI within 30-90 days?  
• Do >70% of testers describe a clear “fun moment”?  
  
𝟱. 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳 ❓  
• What single change could 10x the ‘aha!’ moment?  
• Are we chasing sunk cost or genuine potential?  
• Is our core loop sticky enough to retain players?  
• Do we have the runway to test more hypotheses?
