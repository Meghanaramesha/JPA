# When starting the Development of a New Game

###### When starting the development of a new game, ask yourself:

What’s your superpower?  
  
Because games with a clear superpower succeed.  
  
↳ They build loyal communities.  
↳ They attract players.  
↳ They leave a mark.  
  
Your superpower is your game’s identity.  
  
It’s what players remember.  
So, pinpoint it.  
Embrace it.  
  
• Is it a unique mechanic?  
• A gripping story?  
• Or maybe stunning visuals?  
  
Identifying this early helps focus your team.  
  
It guides decisions.  
  
It shapes the player experience.  
  
So before you dive deep, ask yourself:  
  
What makes our game truly special?
