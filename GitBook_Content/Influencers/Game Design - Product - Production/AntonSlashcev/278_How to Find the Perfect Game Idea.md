###### How to Find the Perfect Game Idea

Spoiler: It’s not just about having a ‘cool concept’.  
  
It’s about aligning key areas:  
  
• Fun Concept – A ‘toy’ that’s enjoyable to play  
• Team Expertise – A project your team is capable of building successfully  
• Players’ Demand – Gameplay that players want and are excited to play  
• Monetization Potential – A genre with the potential to generate profit  
  
True success lies at the intersection of all four.  
  
Hit that sweet spot, and you’ve got your next big game idea.
