###### What causes player churn?

1️⃣ FTUE Issues  
• Poor tutorials: Confusing, unclear, unskippable.  
• Immediate frustration: Bugs, lag, unresponsive buttons.  
• Misleading creatives: Fake gameplay, bait-and-switch.  
• Weak hook: Boring loop, no early reward, no motivation.  
  
2️⃣ Core Gameplay Problems  
• Bad controls: Unresponsive, laggy, clunky.  
• Shallow gameplay: No depth, no synergy, no evolution.  
• Weak feedback: Poor game feel, unclear UI, no haptics.  
• Pacing issues: Inconsistent, no rewarding highs.  
  
3️⃣ Progression Barriers  
• No challenge: Repetitive, no skill mastery, auto-play.  
• Difficulty spikes: Unfair levels, paywalls, OP enemies.  
• Poor progression: Grinding, unbalanced, overly long.  
• No long-term goals: Weak achievements, no endgame.  
  
4️⃣ Economy & Monetization Mistakes  
• Pay-to-win: OP items locked, skill ignored, imbalance.  
• Confusing monetization: No value, too many ads, premium spam.  
• Aggressive currency sinks: Endless drain, frequent pop-ups.  
  
5️⃣ Miscellaneous Issues  
• Community & support: Toxic chat, slow support, no follow-up.  
• Poor communication: No patch clarity, no dev feedback.  
• Technical problems: Poor optimization, crashes, slow loading.  
  
If your game has high churn, check these areas.  
Fix the friction, and keep players engaged.
