###### 10 Game Design Rules You Must Know::

1. 🔍 Reward curiosity  
 ↳ If players wander off the main path, make it worth their time.  
 • Hidden treasures, story snippets, or rare items keep exploration exciting and rewarding.  
  
2. 🏆 Make victory and defeat crystal clear  
 ↳ Avoid confusing win/lose conditions.  
 • Players need to understand how they can succeed, and why they failed.  
 • Visual cues like progress bars or danger symbols (e.g., red or sharp objects) help a lot.  
  
3. 🔄 Be consistent  
 ↳ Patterns build trust.  
 • If the “exit” button is always top-right, keep it there.  
 • Never break the rules you’ve taught players.  
  
4. 🌟 Guide, don’t lecture  
 ↳ Nobody likes a dull tutorial.  
 • Help players learn through subtle hints, not drawn-out lessons.  
 • Let them discover solutions on their own.  
  
5. ⚖️ Keep it fair  
 ↳ Unfair moments break the experience.  
 • Enemies shouldn’t cheat, like teleporting or breaking game physics.  
 • Everyone (even the game itself) should follow the rules.  
  
6. 🎁 Never take away earned rewards  
 ↳ Players hate losing something they worked hard for.  
 • It feels unfair if it’s taken without their input.  
 • Let them give it up only by choice (e.g., selling or swapping).  
  
Exception: During the FTUE, you can give something cool & powerful to hook them and then take it away. Players are fine with this because they didn’t earn it.  
  
7. 🎯 Always provide a clear objective  
 ↳ Players should always know what to do next.  
 • The path can be hard, but the goal must be obvious.  
  
8. 🎮 Fun is the foundation  
 ↳ No amount of rewards, content, or story will matter if the core gameplay isn’t fun.  
 • Make fun the starting point for every design decision.  
  
9. 🗣️ The player is always right  
 ↳ If players are bored, frustrated, or confused, that’s on the design.  
 • Listen to feedback. Players usually point out real issues.  
  
10. 🤝 Respect player choices  
 ↳ When you offer choices, honor them.  
 • Outcomes should match expectations.  
 • Forcing players into a “right” choice ruins immersion.  
  
Good design is about respecting the player.   
  
What rule would you add to the list?
