###### What to do if your game has low retention?

I teamed up with [Mykola Veremiev](/in/mykola-veremiev/) to make a decision tree for your game.  
  
If your game is struggling, ask these questions:   
  
1. Is the FTUE completion rate high?   
2. Are players engaged with the core loop?   
3. Are paywalls causing drop-offs?   
4. Are there difficulty spikes?   
5. Is the player funnel strong?   
6. Is the game technically stable?   
7. Do players have clear long-term goals?   
8. Are players pursuing those goals?   
9. Is feedback on gameplay positive?   
10. Does your team still believe in the vision?   
  
Depending on the answers, you have 3 paths:   
  
• 🔁 Iterate: Minor fixes can boost retention.   
• ↩ Pivot: Core gameplay has potential but lacks depth.   
• ☠ Kill: Systemic issues with no clear solution.   
  
Use data to guide your decisions. Iterate, pivot, or cut your losses.
