# Devs can forget about marketing, as publishers handle it.

“Mobile developers can forget about marketing, as publishers will handle it!”

This is one of the biggest myths in the post-IDFA mobile market.

I’ve worked with nearly all the major publishers: Voodoo, Lion, Supersonic, Crazy Labs, Homa, and I can say for sure:

If you want your game to reach the top, marketing must be a priority from day 1.

Don’t expect your great game to promote itself.

And don’t assume the publisher will care for everything without you.

Not because there’s something wrong with publishers.

But because standing out in today’s overcrowded mobile UA is 𝙚𝙭𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙢𝙚𝙡𝙮 hard.

Here’s what you need to consider:

• How will you grab the player’s attention?  
• How will your product align with those ads?  
• Can you outbid your competitors’ advertising budget?  
• How will you test multiple ad hypotheses every month?  
• How will your game stand out from a sea of similar ads?

Whether you’re with a publisher or self-publishing, please:

Don’t forget about marketing.
