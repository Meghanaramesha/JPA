# Ultimate career advice for newcomers in GameDev

###### The ultimate career advice for newcomers in game development:

Build long-term relationships with your peers.  
  
In this industry, connections are everything.  
  
The gaming industry might seem big, but it is like a “small village.”   
  
You’ll keep running into the same people in surprising ways as your career progresses.  
  
Here’s why relationships matter:  
  
• You never know where your peers will be in 10 years, or where you will be.   
• A single connection can open (or close) big doors down the road.   
• Opportunities often come from those you’ve worked with before.  
  
So, here’s what to do:  
  
• Stay in touch with former colleagues.   
• Keep your promises and always follow through.   
• Help others whenever you can.  
  
The relationships you build today can lead to unexpected opportunities tomorrow.
