# Squad Busters: Revenue Drop by 50% For 2nd Month In A Row.

##### Is it time for Supercell to worry?

###### 📉 In June, daily revenue fell from $1.2M to $600k, a 50% drop.

↳ This was expected as the initial spike was due to organic downloads from pre-registrations.  
  
↳ A decline was anticipated once those settled and user acquisition shifted to paid traffic.  
  
**📉 But in July, daily revenue dropped another 50%: from ±$600k to <$300k.**  
This isn’t just normalization: User Acquisition can’t attract enough traffic at this price. The game probably is far from reaching profitability.

##### **Why did the decline happen again?**

• Very low medium- and long-term retention  
• Day 30 retention does not exceed 3%  
• For comparison, Brawl Stars has nearly 20% Day 30 retention  
  
**Causes:**  
• Insufficient gameplay depth  
• Weak further gacha mechanics  
• Lack of content  
• UX problems  
  
It’s time for Supercell to take more decisive measures to improve the game.
