###### 

Just broke down the most common mobile game monetization mistakes to avoid.  
  
𝟭. First Session Ads 🙅‍♂️  
• Don’t show interstitial ads in the first session.  
• Wait until players clear a few levels.  
• Then, introduce opt-in rewarded ads.  
  
𝟮. Progression Paywalls 🧱  
• Don’t lock core progression strictly behind payment.  
• Let skill be the primary way for players to advance.  
• Instead, monetize time-savers and skip tokens.  
  
𝟯. Starter Pack Pricing 💰  
• Price the starter pack below $5.  
• This lowers the friction for a first purchase.  
• A $1.99 pack with currency and a cosmetic works well.  
  
𝟰. Cluttered Store Offers 🛒  
• Don’t launch with a store full of dozens of offers.  
• Start with 3-4 clear, simple offers.  
• Expand your store lineup based on A/B test results.  
  
𝟱. Ignoring Non-Payers 💸  
• Don’t sideline non-paying players from the economy.  
• Weave ads, IAP, and subscriptions together.  
• Ensure every player segment can create value.  
  
𝟲. Loot Box Transparency 🎲  
• Never hide loot-box odds or pity mechanics.  
• Clearly publish all drop rates for players to see.  
• Guarantee protection with a visible pity timer.  
  
𝟳. Misused FOMO ⏱️  
• Don’t push FOMO timers on low-value items.  
• Reserve countdown offers for truly desirable bundles.  
• This maintains the urgency and value of your offers.  
  
𝟴. Selling Push Notifications 📢  
• Don’t blast push notifications that only sell.  
• Mix your sales nudges with free gifts and content news.  
• This keeps players engaged, not annoyed.  
  
𝟵. Price Localization 🌍  
• Don’t ignore regional purchasing power differences.  
• Localize your price tiers for each market.  
• Adjust prices based on regional ARPPU.  
  
𝟭𝟬. Session Length Mismatch ⏳  
• Don’t design 20-minute loops for mobile play.  
• Build for short, satisfying 3-5 minute sessions.  
• Monetize boosters that fit this quick play style.  
  
𝟭𝟭. Pay-to-Win Mechanics ⚖️  
• Avoid selling unbeatable pay-to-win stats.  
• Focus on monetizing cosmetics or convenience perks.  
• A VIP pass that removes ads is better than a stat bonus.  
  
𝟭𝟮. Ads & IAP Synergy 🤝  
• Don’t treat ads and IAP as isolated systems.  
• Let rewarded ads grant currency for the store.  
• This can nudge players toward making their first purchase.  
  
𝟭𝟯. Stingy Daily Rewards 🎁  
• Don’t be stingy with your daily rewards.  
• Use generous freebies to boost retention.  
• This also increases a player’s propensity to spend.  
  
𝟭𝟰. Offer Personalization 🎯  
• Don’t push identical offers to every player.  
• Personalize bundles based on spend tier and behavior.  
• Low-spenders see a cheap bundle; whales see a premium pack.  
  
𝟭𝟱. Forgetting to Iterate 🔄  
• Don’t stop iterating after one revenue spike.  
• Schedule monthly KPI reviews to track performance.
