# 10 Rules every game designer must follow

###### 10 rules every game designer must follow:

𝟭. 🎁 𝗡𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀   
↳ Players hate losing something they worked hard for.   
• It feels unfair if it’s taken without their input.   
• Let them give it up only by choice (e.g., selling or swapping).   
  
𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: During the FTUE, you can give something cool & powerful to hook them and then take it away. Players are fine with this because they didn’t 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 it.   
  
𝟮. 🎯 𝗔𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗮 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲   
↳ Players should always know what to do next.   
• The path can be hard, but the goal must be obvious.   
  
𝟯. 🏆 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘃𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿   
↳ Avoid confusing win/lose conditions.   
• Players need to understand how they can succeed, and why they failed.   
• Visual cues like progress bars or danger symbols (e.g., red or sharp objects) help a lot.   
  
𝟰. 🔍 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆   
↳ If players wander off the main path, make it worth their time.   
• Hidden treasures, story snippets, or rare items keep exploration exciting and rewarding.   
  
𝟱. 🤝 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀   
↳ When you offer choices, honor them.   
• Outcomes should match expectations.   
• Forcing players into a “right” choice ruins immersion.   
  
𝟲. 🌟 𝗚𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲, 𝗱𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲   
↳ Nobody likes a dull tutorial.   
• Help players learn through subtle hints, not drawn-out lessons.   
• Let them discover solutions on their own.   
  
𝟳. 🗣️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁   
↳ If players are bored, frustrated, or confused, that’s on the design.   
• Listen to feedback. Players usually point out real issues.   
  
𝟴. 🎮 𝗙𝘂𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻   
↳ No amount of rewards, content, or story will matter if the core gameplay isn’t fun.   
• Make fun the starting point for every design decision.   
  
𝟵. 🔄 𝗕𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁   
↳ Patterns build trust.   
• If the “exit” button is always top-right, keep it there.   
• Never break the rules you’ve taught players.   
  
𝟭𝟬. ⚖️ 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗿   
↳ Unfair moments break the experience.   
• Enemies shouldn’t cheat, like teleporting or breaking game physics.   
• Everyone (even the game itself) should follow the rules.   
  
Good design is about respecting the player.
