###### Breaking into the gaming industry is tough.

I did it without any help.  
  
Here’s how:  
  
**1. Start reading job ads**  
You need to know what companies are looking for.  
  
• Check daily job postings  
• Understand industry trends  
• Note the common requirements  
  
**2. Identify missing skills**  
Find out what you lack.  
  
• List the gaps  
• Prioritize the most crucial ones  
• Compare your skills with job ads  
  
**3. Enforce your skill set**  
Fill those gaps with dedication.  
  
• Take online courses  
• Practice regularly  
• Build a portfolio  
  
**4. Build your network**  
Connections are key.  
  
• Attend industry events  
• Join online forums  
• Reach out to professionals  
  
Remember during the process:  
  
• Patience is Key  
• Sustainable Learning  
• Have fun and enjoy the process  
  
Our industry needs you.
