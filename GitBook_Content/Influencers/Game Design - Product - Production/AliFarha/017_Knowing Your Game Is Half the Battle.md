##### But the other half? Understanding the genres.

##### To simplify, here’s a list:

**1. MMORPGs  
2. Puzzle Games  
3. Hybrid Games  
4. Sports Games  
5. Shooter Games  
6. Fighting Games  
7. Platform Games  
8. Simulation Games  
9. Dance/Rhythm Games  
10. Survival Horror Games  
11. Action Adventure Games  
12. Role Playing Games (RPGs)  
13. Turn Based Strategy Games  
14. Real Time Strategy (RTS) Games**  
  
*This list is by no means exhaustive or strict.*

Each genre can overlap and bleed into another.

The only limit is the imagination of the game developers.
