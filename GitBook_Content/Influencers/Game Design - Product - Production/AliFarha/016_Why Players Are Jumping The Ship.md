##### Most likely you are one of them.

###### To understand why players abandon games before completion, we must understand player behavior and market trends.

###### The main reasons behind this trend:

**1. The Challenge Factor**  
Difficulty spikes and frustrating gameplay elements often deter players from going further.  
  
**2. Engagement Shortfalls**  
Games that fail to consistently engage players with exciting content or mechanics often face high abandonment rates.  
  
**3. Shiny Object**  
Players ‘ preferences constantly evolve with the era of new games and genres being launched.  
  
**4. The Time Dilemma**  
Modern lifestyles allow limited gaming time. Consequently, games that demand significant time investment risk being abandoned for shorter, more accessible experiences.  
  
**5. Financial Aspects**  
Given the rising costs of games coupled with economic uncertainties, players may prefer free-to-play games or those sold at discounted prices.
