###### How to secure your spot? Three key takeaways:

**1. Innovate:** Scopely’s “MONOPOLY GO!” launch was a game-changer, becoming the biggest mobile game launch in the United States.  
 **2. Build Community:** Gaming isn’t just about play and connection. Scopely’s “commitment to cultivating highly social experiences” fosters engagement across generations and geographies.  
  
**3. Create Impact:** TIME evaluates companies based on impact. Scopely’s growth to the #1 mobile games company in the U.S. demonstrates the significance of their influence.  
  
*Success comes from the ability to translate vision into reality.*  
Scopely’s recognition proves that the gaming industry is not just about entertainment.  
  
It’s a platform for innovation, community building, and global impact.  
  
And remember, it’s not about the destination. It’s about who you become, the communities you build, and the lives you touch.
