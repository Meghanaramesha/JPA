In a bidding war with zeros I cannot count.

What acquiring Warner Bros means for games.  
  
*Instant access to franchises that took decades to build:*  
– Mortal Kombat  
– Batman Arkham  
– Hogwarts Legacy  
– Middle earth games  
– LEGO titles  
– and more..  
  
This isn’t just another acquisition.  
  
It’s a streaming company buying its way into AAA gaming.  
  
The question everyone should ask:  
  
Will a content first company know how to run game studios?
