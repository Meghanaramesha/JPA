# Girls und Panzer Partnership in WoT!

###### We’ve just launched a collaboration with Girls und Panzer in WoT! Hooray!🌟In my personal opinion this is a great and wholesome anime for those who love tank history. And that’s why:

— A lot of different vehicles made with care and respect to historic details. Tanks are also main characters of this show!  
— Non-violent setting! Everything is presented as a sports competition between different schools. All tanks are equipped to conduct staged battles, without real danger to the participants (it may not always be believable though).  
— Different schools based on references to different countries with a little flair around it. And with fitting vehicles fleets.  
— Lighthearted story, quite simple and rather good for such a theme. It is building the foundation for competition between different schools with extensive tank battles in it.  
  
But I admit, I may be a bit biased. When I watched this show for the first time – it was because of the WWII tanks. And the tanks were awesome and treated with proper respect!✨   
  
But, back to WoT collaboration! Can’t wait for the start of the event.   
Kudos to the team members who made this possible! 💖
