###### While we may be living in a time of crisis for the gaming industry, there are still a lot of cool games that have been released or are coming out. On different platforms and markets, both indie and AAA, even MMORPG has a lot of stuff! 😎 🎉

This year looks truly special for the MMORPG genre. There are:  
— Expansion for the World of Warcraft  
— Expansion for the Final Fantasy XIV Online (with boosted graphics)  
— Updates in Destiny and TESO  
— Guild Wars 3 development confirmed  
— Pax Dei, Blue Protocol, Throne and Liberty planned for release this year  
  
Personally I want to check up FFXIV. Already played for 100 hours, but it is clearly not enough. 🤗
