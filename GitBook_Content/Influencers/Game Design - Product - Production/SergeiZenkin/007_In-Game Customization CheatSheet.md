Master the types of in-game customization with a single cheat sheet!🎀✨  
Use it to find a way to implement more meaningful customization in your own game.  
  
It’s almost universal and can be used for lots of game genres (with some creative adaptation). The best fit should be for RPGs, Shooters, Multiplayer games, and Character-oriented projects with heroes, vehicles, weapons, tools, and other stuff that can be collected and used in that way.  
  
Remember, customization can be used:  
— As basic content, available for everyone  
— As a content reward  
— As a status reward, for example in ranked or challenging quests  
— In monetization features  
  
📊Based on that, always check what you aim for improving gameplay and game systems, setting goals and working with retention, and developing diverse monetization that makes more sense overall.   
  
🎯Don’t overinvest in a single direction or specific part of it to avoid a one-sided design.  
  
💃Always check during the design phase that players can enjoy their customization. And in multiplayer games – check their ability to show off “vanity” stuff.
