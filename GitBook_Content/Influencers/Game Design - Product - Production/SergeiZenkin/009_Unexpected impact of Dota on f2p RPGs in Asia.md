###### 🕹Gamedev history: The unexpected impact of Dota on f2p RPGs in Asia. 🐔💤

Once there was a game, capitalized greatly on the Dota lore and content, had collab with Assassin creed 2 and placed major mark on f2p RPG genre in Asia. Gameplay was about going into battles with Dota characters, doing ultimates and leveling heroes with same items just like in Dota. The name of the game was Dot Arena.✨   
  
It seems that the overall idea of dota-like progression is later impacted other games in the genre a lot. Many of modern f2p RPG often designed and structured in the rather similar way (e.g. Blue Archive).   
(but for now it is more a guess than a proper research 🧐)   
  
The Dot Arena was an instant hit, the core idea was super familiar to the players and capitalization on the existing title helped to get rather wide audience. The live ops path of the game ended with massive legal issues in China and imminent closure. The crown was passed to Heroes Charge, almost the same project in terms of setting and gameplay, but built differently, without so strict resemblance with the Dota.⚜   
  
**P.S.** It is also looking like developers of the game got to the much bigger and more ambitious games after its original success.
