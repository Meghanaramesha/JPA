###### 90% of Games Fail at Monetization

The truth?   
  
Monetization Model isn’t about squeezing every dollar – it’s about finding what WORKS for YOUR game.  
  
I’ve laid out 6 models with:  
  
🟢 The wins.  
🔴 The pitfalls.  
  
But first, focus on these 4 factors:  
  
1. Game Genre  
  
• Story-heavy? Go premium.  
• Fast-paced? Free-to-play wins.  
  
2. Target Audience  
  
• Casuals love “free.”  
• Hardcore? They’ll pay for the good stuff.  
  
3. Game Lifespan  
  
• Subscriptions win with long-term play.  
• Short-term? In-game payments do the job.  
  
4. Game Design & Value  
  
• Players will pay if it’s worth it.  
• But don’t pull shady pay-to-win moves.  
  
Monetization is NOT just about the money.  
  
It’s about building trust, delivering value, and creating something players want to come back to.
