###### Mistakes New Game Devs Make

Building a game isn’t just about release.  
It’s about avoiding the issues that kill it.  
  
Here’s where beginners go wrong:  
  
1. They think ideation is all that matters.  
 ↳ Sure, a great concept is key.  
 ↳ But it’s just the start of the journey.  
  
2. They underestimate Post-Production.  
 ↳ This isn’t a casual polish phase.  
 ↳ It’s about final fixes and tuning.  
  
3. Live Ops? Totally overlooked.  
 ↳ Continuous updates are a must.  
 ↳ Player retention is built over time.  
  
4. They skip on player feedback.  
 ↳ Feedback isn’t a “nice to have”  
 ↳ It’s essential to polish, balance, improve.  
  
If you’re not ready for every stage,  
you’re not ready to keep your game alive.  
  
Mistakes in planning cost more than time.  
  
In games, they cost players.
