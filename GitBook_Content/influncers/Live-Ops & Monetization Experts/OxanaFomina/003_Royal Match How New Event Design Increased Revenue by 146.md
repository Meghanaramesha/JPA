In May 2025, [Dream Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamgames/) launched a new weekend tournament in RoyalMatch, Propeller Rush. The player competes in 30-minute rounds against four opponents, aiming to create the most Propeller bonuses. The event has three stages with increasing rewards, but losing at any stage immediately ends the tournament. To advance, the player must take first place every time. This weekend’s tournament runs from Friday to Sunday.

The “sudden death” rule — the event ends after the first loss, creating a unique sense of risk and intensity compared to traditional tournaments. “Sudden death” elimination rule after any loss is a new feature for popular Match-3 games.  
This mechanic immediately proved effective: during the first 3 days, revenue increased by 14.6% compared to the previous weekend. The tension of “one mistake and you’re out” not only raised engagement but also drove spending from players motivated to keep competing.  
  
Royal Match has hosted tournament events since 2021. The long-running Lightning Bolts Tournament runs Monday–Thursday, lasts 1 hour, and allows cumulative progress without sudden elimination. It appeals to Achievers and Explorers who enjoy steady play and experimentation.  
  
By contrast, the new Propeller Rush weekend event targets Competitors and Killers — players who thrive on pressure, prestige, and the emotional intensity of high-stakes play. This archetype is more willing to spend to continue competing and secure victory.  
  
The event design continues to evolve: rewards have been adjusted, and the third stage (Diamond Propeller Rush) was removed at the end of August 2025 to optimize balance.

What makes this approach powerful is the complementary design:

·        Weekday tournament (Mon–Thu) satisfies Achievers/Explorers  
·        Weekend tournament (Fri–Sun) satisfies Competitors/Killers

Together, they expand the event audience instead of competing with each other.

This is an excellent example of LiveOps strategy: modifying existing formats to reach new archetypes, monetizing different player motivations, and letting events complement each other to maximize engagement and revenue.
