# Fishdom by Playrix: Fantastic Results

What I truly admire about [Playrix](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playrix-entertainment/)’s games is their innovative approach to monetization and retention. Let’s explore the event that led to fantastic 📈 results according to [Sensor Tower](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sensor-tower/) data:  
+32.3% 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞  
+44.4% 𝐀𝐑𝐏𝐏𝐔  
+13% 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐒𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬  
+16.6% 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐭

Over the past two years, Fishdom has introduced long-term meta-events that run for nearly a month. These aren’t just side content—they’re strategic systems with independent mechanics layered over the core gameplay, keeping players engaged on multiple levels.  
  
🔍 On the [Playliner](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playliner/) calendar below, you can see two examples:

One with a Merge mechanic  
One with an Expedition mechanic  
Let’s dive deeper into the 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭—especially how it evolved in 2024 with the introduction of the 𝐆𝐞𝐦𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐥 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭.  
🗺️ Expedition is an exploration event with its own map, storyline, and energy system. Players explore, clear obstacles, collect resources, and help characters progress.  
💎 Gemstone Trail runs alongside it—a 3-day milestone event repeated several times during the Expedition. Players complete 15 tasks by collecting items, which can only be found by playing the Expedition event.

This dual-event system successfully increases metrics by creating a compelling loop where progress in one event directly benefits the other. It also offers multiple meaningful purchase opportunities and clear rewards for engagement.
