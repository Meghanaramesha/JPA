### Brawl Stars x Toy Story

From December 12th to February 5th, Buzz Lightyear becomes the first playable character from outside the Brawl Stars universe. Along with his debut, three unique battle modes – laser, wing, and saber – pay homage to iconic moments from the Toy Story franchise. The event also features Toy Story-inspired skins for Colt (Woody Colt), Bibi (Bo Peep Bibi), and Jessie (Jessie Jessie), while Surge will get a Buzz Lightyear skin after the event ends.

Starting January 2nd, Starr Park transforms into the Pizza Planet Arcade, where players collect Pizza Slices to unlock Toy Story-themed cosmetics and even a new Brawler. With nostalgic vibes and creative gameplay, this collaboration blends Toy Story’s magic with Brawl Stars’ chaos.

Frank Keienburg, Brawl Stars General Manager, shared his excitement: “Toy Story is the ideal collab for us, as the theme of teamwork and creating connections with others is at the core of Brawl Stars. It’s awesome to team up with Disney and Pixar, and especially cool to drop Buzz Lightyear as our first-ever playable character who is not part of the Brawl Stars universe.”
