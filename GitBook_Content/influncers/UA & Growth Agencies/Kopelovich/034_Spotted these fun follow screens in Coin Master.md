##### 📱 Spotted these fun follow screens in Coin Master 👀

What I really like here is how they cover all audiences – whether you’re active on X, YouTube, or even Facebook (I recall seeing one for FB too).  
  
It’s a smart way to build community across multiple platforms, making sure every type of player has an entry point to stay engaged with updates, contests, and rewards.  
  
Small detail, but a big impact on reach & retention.  
  
👉 Curious – which platform do you think works best for mobile game community building today?
