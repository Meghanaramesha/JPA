###### 👾🎬 Brawl Stars x Stranger Things

Supercell officially revealed its new collaboration with Stranger Things, one of the biggest seasonal crossovers the game has ever done.  
  
The event brings the Upside Down to Starr Park, featuring themed skins, a new roguelite mode, and waffles as a collectible event currency 🍽️  
  
Highlights from the collab 👇  
✅ New roguelite mode “Upside Showdown” where players progress through five stages, pick powers, and battle for trophies and waffles  
✅ New event currency “Waffles” that can be traded for cards and rewards in a special shop  
✅ Boss fights against Vecna and the Demogorgon  
✅ Stranger Things–inspired skins including Eleven Lumi, Dustin Nita, Hopper Bull, and more  
  
This crossover blends Brawl Stars’ fast-paced gameplay with Stranger Things’ dark world, while also introducing fresh mechanics like card-based upgrades and roguelite runs. It’s a big step in design depth for a seasonal event.
