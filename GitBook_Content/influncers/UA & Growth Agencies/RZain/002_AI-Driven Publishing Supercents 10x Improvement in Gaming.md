**Source:** Lucio Im, Head of Publishing at Supercent, Pocket Gamer Connects (PGC) Korea Summit 2025.

At PGC Korea 2025, Supercent unveiled a new paradigm in mobile game publishing, shifting from a data-driven to an **AI-driven operational model**. This approach systemizes game development and scaling, achieving a documented **5% hit rate** (10x the industry average of 0.5%) by leveraging AI across the entire lifecycle from core loop validation to global user acquisition. This represents a fundamental evolution in capital efficiency and de-risking for game investments.

### Market Problem & Performance Data

Lucio Im highlighted that the mobile gaming market is notoriously winner-take-all, with only **0.5% of games achieving over 10 million downloads**. This high failure rate is driven by gut-driven development, inefficient UA spend, and an inability to predict player retention and LTV pre-launch.

Supercent’s AI-driven system demonstrably shatters this norm:

* **Hit Rate:** A **5% success rate** for games discovered and scaled under their direction, a **10x improvement** over the industry standard.
* **Performance Metrics:** Proven ability to drastically improve key game health indicators:

### The AI-Driven System: A Scalable Framework for Success

According to the presentation, Supercent’s competitive edge is a structured, five-stage publishing system (PSL) that is now fully integrated with AI. This system moves beyond simple A/B testing to predictive optimization.

**Core Pillars of the AI Integration:**

1. **Market Potential & Gamification:** AI analyzes global trends and uses Supercent’s vast repository of internal test data to predict market opportunities and validate core game loops before full production.
2. **Profitability & Meta-Loop Optimization:** The system is fundamentally data-first. AI continuously refines meta-progression systems (e.g., talent trees, skins, boss fights) and runs automated A/B tests to maximize player engagement and LTV.
3. **Scalability & UA Automation:** The model leverages **ROAS-based global UA expertise**. AI is used to automate campaign management and optimize creative-to-game matching, dramatically improving UA efficiency and allowing human strategists to focus on high-level planning.

### Direct Impact on User Acquisition & Monetization

* **Lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** By using AI to identify and target players who exhibit behaviors associated with high LTV, Supercent acquires higher-quality users at a lower cost.
* **Higher Lifetime Value (LTV):** The documented 5-10x LTV increase is a direct result of AI-optimized meta-systems and retention mechanics. This creates a powerful virtuous cycle where higher LTV allows for more aggressive and profitable UA spending.
* **Fully Automated Scaling:** Lucio Im’s vision for 2026-2028 is a “hands-off” UA engine where AI manages campaign execution. This shifts human capital from operational tasks to strategic innovation, creating a scalable and defensible moat.

### Conclusion & Strategic Imperative

As presented by Lucio Im at PGC Korea, Supercent is not merely a game publisher; it is a technology company that has productized game success. Their AI-driven publishing system represents a fundamental de-risking of game development and scaling.

For VCs, this presents a dual opportunity:

1. **Direct Investment:** Backing the platform itself offers exposure to a high-margin, scalable tech business that can be applied to a vast portfolio of games.
2. **Portfolio Strategy:** Investing in game studios that partner with or emulate this AI-driven, metrics-first approach is a bet on the future of capital-efficient game development.

The demonstrated 10x improvement in hit rate and the systematic amplification of LTV prove that the future of gaming growth is not just data-informed, but **AI-optimized**.
