They have been reshaping Mobile Gaming, building an ecosystem that covers everything.
It’s become a one-stop shop spanning Ad Tech, UA, CTV, Monetization, Creatives, and even its own Games!
Alright – Let’s start with the fun part –NASDAQ!

Special thanks to Brian Truman for putting his 2 cents out here:
Since ATT, on iOS Meta has had trouble with attribution. Yes, APP has a great team and killer ML chops. Their prediction algorithms are remarkable. But what makes APP truly the best is winning the attribution game. They have benefited tremendously from Apple’s shift toward privacy and SKAN.When serving an ad that they created via their own SDK they are collecting strong data points that are passed to the MMP and that probabilistic match is far more likely to be credited to APP than another ad source. This means, if there is more than one possible last-touch ad source that falls within the attribution window, AppLovin is most likely to win.
Q3’24 Highlights:
Revenue:$1.2B, up 39% YoY
Adjusted EBITDA:$722M, marking a 72% YoY growth
Free Cash Flow:$545M, a remarkable 182% rise YoY
Software Platform Revenue:$835M, up 66% YoY
What’s Behind?AppLovin’s Ad Tech growth, driven by advanced AI in the AXON platform, is catching eyes. They’re now expanding from Gaming into e-commerce, where early results promise almost 100% incremental growth.
Looking Ahead:Q4 guidance remains strong, forecasting $1.25B, and AppLovin is doubling down on share buybacks, adding $2B to its authorization.
AppLovin’s #1 Competitor – Unity?

Controversial Pricing Model: In 2023, Unity introduced a “Runtime Fee” tied to game installations, sparking backlash.Runtime fee was revoked in 2024.
Leadership Changes: CEO John Riccitiello resigned in October 2023 amidst the pricing controversy.New CEO Matthew Brombergtook over in May 2024 to restore trust.
Layoffs: Unitycut 25% of its workforcein January 2024 as part of a reset, focusing on core areas.
Financial Challenges: Revenue has been under pressure, with a 16% drop in Q2 2024, prompting a reduced annual outlook.
ironSource Integration: Acquired to boost monetization, ironSource’s integration hasadded restructuring challenges.
“Alleged bullying and mismanagement within Unity’s Ad Tech arm have led to a toxic atmosphere, unhappy staff, and dozens of resignations, we’re told.”
Back in August’20, Unityturned down a huge $20B merger offerfrom AppLovin. Instead, they teamed up with ironSource to level up their Monetization tools.
AppLovin wasn’t ready to give up just yet. They wanted to make a big splash in the market butdropped their offerby September’22 after Unity’s choice, realizing that Unity & ironSource together could be a fierce competitor.
Then, in October’23,AppLovin’s interest in Unity fired upagain.
Unity’s new Runtime Fee sparked developer frustration, and CEO John Riccitiello stepped down, opening the door for AppLovin to make a move. They rolled out some new AI tools to win over Devs, hinting they might either team up with Unity or go head-to-head to shake things up.

Monopoly?
By centralizing every aspect of Growth & Monetization, AppLovin has become an indispensable partner in Mobile Gaming, from UA & Analytics to Monetization & Creative Development.
AppLovin is shaking things up big time. They’re not just playing in the mobile ad space, they’re pushing e-commerce to new heights with killer tech, like Shopify integration through their AXON Platform, which finds the best users for brands. Results? Doubling traffic. It’s not just Ads anymore; it’s a whole new way for e-commerce to win on mobile.
What if AppLovin goes after Unity now? With MoPub already in the back pocket, AppLovin could be bold enough to take on Unity, especially now that Unity’s future seems a bit wobbly. Sure, it might raise a few eyebrows, but AppLovin has the resources to pull it off – and the timing couldn’t be better.
With the Unity deal, AppLovin would be setting up the ultimate package for Devs: A True One-stop Shop for building, scaling, and monetizing games with data at its core. Imagine the perks for Game Devs – better tools, lower costs, and serious insights.
AppLovin would be rolling out the red carpet for them in every way possible, creating a game-changer for mobile that everyone’s going to want a piece of.
If the Ironsource & Unity deal had turned out well, maybe this Monopoly Empire would not have been for AppLovin!
