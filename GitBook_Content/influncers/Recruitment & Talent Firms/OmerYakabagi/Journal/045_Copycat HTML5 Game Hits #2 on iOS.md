For Mobile Game & HTML5 Devs, this story is a cautionary tale; success on one platform can lead to exploitation on another.

Just3 days later, an iOS game calledMy Baby or Not!appeared on the App Store—looking identicaltoDiapers, Please!The SS, Gameplay & Description werecopied word-for-word:
“Immerse yourself in an alternative 1920s world where a totalitarian state and impeccable bureaucracy conceal deep secrets…”
VoltekPlay sounded the alarm, writing on itch.io:“It’s literally just our game, wrapped in a mobile shell—uploaded without our permission by someone who didn’t contribute at all.”
While Apple erased the stolen games, it’s unclear if Benyssef will keep his profits. Meanwhile,VoltekPlay earned nothing and paid legal fees.

A Pattern of Theft?
The App Store creditedMy Baby or Not!toMarwane Benyssef, an unknown developer withno prior history in mobile gaming. His only other iOS game?Kiosk Food Night Shift—which appears to be another directcopy of an HTML5 gameoriginally posted on itch.io.
VoltekPlay quickly filed a DMCA takedown, but Apple initially responded by encouraging them to“resolve the claim directly”with the alleged thief. However, Apple soon removed Benyssef’s entire developer page and all of his games from the App Store.

Apple’s Selective Protection?
Apple’s guidelines warn against blatant clones but focus on protecting games already on the App Store, not HTML5 titles published on open platforms. This loophole has led to widespread cloning issues, much like the flood of Wordle clones that took days to remove in 2022.
VoltekPlay notes that using Godot Engine madeDiapers, Please!easy to decompile and repackage for iOS. Some developers now advise encrypting and obfuscating code to prevent similar theft.
