Sudoku Master by [Hungry Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hungrystudio2021/) (the makers of Block Blast) scaled past $50K a day and already has 600K+ DAU. Can this game compete with [Miniclip](https://www.linkedin.com/company/miniclip/)‘s dominance of the Numbers genre?

The game itself is a very simple version of Sudoku. You fill in numbers based on the game rules and then you progress through harder and harder boards. The monetization is done through rewarded ads 📺, which can either give you hints during core gameplay or you can get more lives if you fail. Of course there are interstitials between the levels. Similarly to Block Blast, the game is very simple, but I guess Hungry’s signature balancing plays a big role, as you also need to answer few question in the onboarding to set your initial difficulty.   
  
As mentioned, this category is dominated by [Miniclip](https://www.linkedin.com/company/miniclip/) with their [Easybrain](https://www.linkedin.com/company/easybrain/) games Sudoku. com and Numbers Match. First one has 3,3 Mil. DAU and the other one 1,6 Mil. So obviously they have the advantage. If you look at the download numbers of all 3 games for last month, it is pretty much the same 1.5 -1.8 Mil. downloads for each. But, and a big 𝐁𝐔𝐓, Sudoku Master had 6K 😵! different ad creatives last month compared to 500 of both Miniclip games. Which means they are running  𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 10𝐱 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐔𝐀 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫!   
  
This just proves the cold truth that mobile games market is basically one giant UA war ⚔️. And Hungry Studio is at the tip of the spear, as they are running 14K different creatives on Block Blast for the last month 😱, which seems to be the 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭, Monopoly GO follows with 10K in second place.
