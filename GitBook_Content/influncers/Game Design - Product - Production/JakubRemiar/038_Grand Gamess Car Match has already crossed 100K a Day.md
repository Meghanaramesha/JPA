# Grand Games’s Car Match has already crossed $100K a Day!

[Grand Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grandgames/)‘s Car Match already crossed $100K a day 🤑 in revenue, while their other game Magic Sort makes $190K a day in parallel. Is it this another Dream Games in the making or is it gonna be hampered by its UA?

The game is essentially an alternative execution of [Voodoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/voodoo.io/)‘s Block Jam 3D as you can see the core gameplay. But on much higher production values as it follows the Dream Games formula of looking like a Pixar movie 📽️ in context of visual quality. This way it is much more skewed towards microtransactions in its overall revenue profile. But let’s be honest, with the current competition in puzzle games, you really need to look like this to even have a chance at the table 😅.   
  
This is not the studio’s first game as Magic Sort 🧴 already made more than $25 mil., which puts this as a second successful puzzler in the portfolio. Why this is the right strategy? Because they reused the whole metagame of Magic Sort, all the events, UIs, monetization systems etc. This means that this game cost much less and was much faster to make compared to first one. And you know what will happen? They are probably already making a 3rd puzzler in the meantime. I would guess that it would be either in the block 🟦 or physics sub-category, as those are still waiting for their big IAP casual game.   
  
But not everything is rosy as [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) said and it seem that the UA is not able to catch with the excellent quality of the product. The game is outstanding from the genre and monetization perspective, but it doesn’t use enough creative concepts in its ads in order to continue scaling with this momentum, as the daily downloads are already declining. Will they be able to fix this?
