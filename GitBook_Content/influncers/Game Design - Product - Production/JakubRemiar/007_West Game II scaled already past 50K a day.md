# West Game II scaled already past $50K a day!

West Game II scaled already past $50K a day 🤑 in two months and it is sitting in [Tripledot Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tripledot-studios/) portfolio? 😳

This is a continuation of West Game, a 4X game by Chinese studio Leyi Games, which already grossed $300M lifetime revenue. This time, they got the latest template upgrade from Kingshot and they follow this year’s top new game nearly one to one except the western theme 😅. So we have the first high profile clone of Kingshot.

#### Why Tripledot?

Because this studio was part of the [AppLovin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/applovin/) games portfolio that was sold off 💸 to Tripledot, which included multiple Chinese companies. Will this mean that we will see more midcore games in the portfolio or more aggressive UA tactics in the style of 4X on other Tripledot games?  
  
Every western team should pay attention to their launch month creatives. They are running more than 1000 of them 😅. You can really see how hard they are trying to find the winning concept, if not multiple ones.
