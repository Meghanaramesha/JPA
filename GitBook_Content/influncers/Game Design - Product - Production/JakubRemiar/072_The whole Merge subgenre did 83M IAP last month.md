###### The whole Merge subgenre did $83 Million IAP revenue 🤑 last month.

Back in 2020 Merge Dragons did $10 Mil. a month and there were no Merge 2 games to oppose it, so how did we got here?

Currently, Gossip Harbor is leading the whole category, doing $35 Mil. a month being followed by Travel Town with $21. Mil. But this was not always the case and as you see the graph on the bottom, before, there were only Merge 3 or isometric merge games. Gram Games’s Merge Dragons launching in 2017 still doing around $4 Mil. a month had already passed $435 Mil. lifetime 💰 revenue. It was later followed by Big Fish Games’s Evermerge in 2019, which already got past $120 Mil. lifetime. This subgenre peaked in May 2020 and is declining ever since. What happened there?  
  
Metacore’s Merge Mansion was launched in June 2020 and quickly took the old guard by storm. The Merge 2 games revenue overtook Merge 3 for the first time in October 2022, where it was 50/50 and it just kept scaling from that point until today, when the ratio as you see is nearly 7 to 1 in favor of Merge 2 😱. Merge Mansion was leading until Jan 2024 when it got overtaken by now [MoonActive Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moonactive-ltd/)‘s Travel Town, which got also overtaken by [Microfun](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microfun/)‘s Gossip Harbor in November 2024.   
  
This just shows you how much more scalable the Merge 2 gameplay is compared to Merge 3, as it offers much less player “maintenance” of the board, no scrolling needed to go around, the quest system give clear direction of what to merge and of course the overall readability of tokens on the board is easier. Even though Merge Mansion just recently hit record monthly revenue of $9 Mil., the overall market has grown so much that it is still not enough against the Microfun’s UA firepower that is taking 65% of the overall monthly merge market revenue.
