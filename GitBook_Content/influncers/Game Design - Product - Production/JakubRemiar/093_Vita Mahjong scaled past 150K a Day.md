# Vita Mahjong scaled past $150K a Day

###### Vita Mahjong has already scaled past $150K a day in ad revenue & daily 400K downloads.

*In nearly one year, the game went past 65M downloads.*

Why is it scaling so high? 😎 Get the story here:

This is another example of turning the established board games 🎲 into a level-based puzzle version on mobile. Similar to Domino Dreams by [SuperPlay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/superplay/) and Solitaire Grand Harvest by [Playtika](https://www.linkedin.com/company/playtika/), these games just take elements from the well known board games, but they heavily simplify it, so it becomes a level based puzzler. Despite that, it still retains the organic search traffic for the original game as players are looking for a Mahjong game. Clever iteration 💡.   
  
Vita Mahjong has very small feature set; there is just the level-based core gameplay and some minimal events in the main menu, and that’s it. No progression or any other additional mechanics. This follows the winning formula of Block Blast 🟧, where development is dedicated to the adjustments of the difficulty and the player funnels, so the game in the end has outstanding retention. As this is an ad-driven game, you just want players to stick around for a long time; no need to push them into paying through difficult levels.   
  
The marketing strategy itself is one of its key advantages. It’s based on the “game is designed for seniors” 👴 concept. With AI-generated doctors and seniors proclaiming that the game helps them, or your usual Einstein increasing your IQ, etc. It’s executed very well, and as said, with the use of AI, the game is able to produce giant amount of creatives, which enabled it to scale to 400K downloads a day. Again, a similar strategy to Block Blast. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.
