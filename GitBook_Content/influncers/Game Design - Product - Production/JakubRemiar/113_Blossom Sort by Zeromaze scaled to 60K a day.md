###### Blossom Sort by Zeromaze scaled to $60K a day with only 20K downloads per day 😅. This unconventional take on the sort puzzle is packing more than 1 trick up its sleeve. Read the full rundown here 😎:

Instead of the usual sorting mechanic, like water puzzles or Colorwood, where you can move pieces only on the same color pieces, here you can freely move flowers 🌺 around the pots even though they will be put near a flower that is a different type. Breaking this major sorting rule gives the game a much more relaxing feeling and also solves one of the fail state problems. As fail state here is is either done by running out of time ⏳ or running out of space to move flowers.   
  
Even though the game runs a lot of ads, it still monetizes very well with IAP purchases, putting it currently on the 6th spot 💸 in the match pair category by revenue, which is led by Match Factory. As you see on the main menu, it uses the standard Royal Match metagame of short events with a decoration visual progression + the collectible album. As I have written here many times, it is one of the most used progression mechanics in casual genre, that is becoming a golden standard now 🥇.   
  
The secret trick that the game unfolds after level 30 is its second core gameplay. You will be playing line match puzzle 🧩, which is connecting the same flowers in line match fashion during levels which are move based. Why is this here? You guessed it, because it works in the UA creatives. This is now becoming a very standard pattern where there needs to be a 2nd core to mitigate the impact of the “fake UA” creatives in a casual puzzle.
