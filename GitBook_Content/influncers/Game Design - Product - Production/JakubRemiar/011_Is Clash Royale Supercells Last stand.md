# Is Clash Royale Supercell’s Last stand?

Is Clash Royale [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/)‘s Last stand?

It just had its 3rd best month in its 9 year old history with 78$ Mil. in revenue for October, but further outlook looks much different 🤔…

Clash Royale has already peaked, following a similar pattern like Brawl Stars on both revenue and downloads curve. Even the whole scaling phase took nearly the same 9 months. Brawl Stars is declining from its peak ever since for last 17 months. Will Clash Royale will only decline from this point then? Most probably, even though it will be a very lucrative decline, but a decline nevertheless.  
  
And this is the part where the long term outlook starts to look pretty grim for the Finnish mobile juggernaut. After 7 years Brawl Stars is still their last successful “youngest, billion a year” game in the portfolio. After it, there were 9 other soft launched games, which were all killed ☠️. The streak continues with Squad Busters’ demise at the end of last month. So this leaves us with 3 more known projects on the table, but I am sure there are many more in development just unannounced.  
  
All of the latest games are a reflection of Supercell’s signature strategy of being very creative, tackling new genres and perfecting mainstream concepts. But this has not produced a hit for the last 7 years. Is this strategy still viable in 2025? As we see the onslaught of rising Chinese companies doubling down on their core genre focus and scaling their games through very aggressive UA tactics, this seems like an outdated setup. Whether we like it or not, this is the current state of the market and Supercell will need to radically adjust to it eventually or risk being pushed to the sidelines.
