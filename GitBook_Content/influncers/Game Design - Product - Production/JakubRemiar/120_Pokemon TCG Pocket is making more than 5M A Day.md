# Pokemon TCG Pocket is making more than $5M A Day!

###### Pokemon TCG Pocket is killing it 🤩 still doing more than $5 Mil. 🤑 a day! I had to pull out my old cards from the “childhood box” to confirm that a lot of them are now in the mobile game using the exact OG illustrations 😁. Couldn’t be more happy to play again with these familiar faces 😊.

The [DeNA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dena/) team did a great job by streamlining the original physical Trading Card Game rules. Instead of 60 cards you now only have 20 cards in your whole deck. Energy system was again simplified. Similarly how Hearthstone removed the lands as it was streamlining Magic the Gathering gameplay, Pocket also removed energy cards out of the deck and made it an automatic resource that is constantly given to you each round regardless of your cards. If you go for double color deck, the energy generated is randomized. Instead of 6 prize cards for defeating 6 of your opponent’s pokemon, you now need to only defeat 3 and there are no prize cards 😅. This trade off of lowering the strategic depth for more shorter mobile friendly gameplay hit a very nice sweet spot for now.  
  
Even though to some ppl it may seem too simplistic, keep in mind that new card expansion will probably add more mechanics and complexity into the meta, similarly how stadium cards were added into the physical TCG for instance. So starting this simple is actually a great starting point as it will definitely get more complex pretty soon as next expansion is already slated for January! 😁. There are so many cool things in this game to talk about, can’t wait when we will do a full review with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) this week on [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎. Get your deck ready!
