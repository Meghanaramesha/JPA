# War Drone 3D by Miniclip already scaled to $70K a day!

War Drone 3D by [Miniclip](https://www.linkedin.com/company/miniclip/) already scaled to $70K 🤑a day in both IAP+ Ad revenue. Still doing 150K downloads a day its the most downloaded game in the Sniper category, how did they do it?

The game perfectly communicates the drone operator fantasy concept. As you see on the top image, which is the core gameplay of an “isometric shooter” 🔫, you operate multiple weapon systems and active abilities in order to essentially defend a crash site. Everything is black and white, pretty generic to keep the immersion of the drone view. Creation of these locations therefore seems much easier than your usual shooter environment. You upgrade 3 main weapons and unlock passive and active abilities through a gacha for progression. And that’s basically it. This makes the game quite simple but still pretty deep to master.   
  
As said on the podcast, the game makes around 50-60% of revenue through Ads and the rest through IAP, which makes it a perfect Hybrid. It is driven mainly by organic traffic, which we can guess is fueled by the current news context of multiple open war conflicts around the world as unfortunate as it sounds. When we look at this unique sub genre of shooter games called Sniper, this game basically goes neck and neck against the long term leader of this category, Sniper 3D ⚔️ by [Wildlife Studios](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wildlife-studios/), which was released on 2014, even though War Drone was soft launched in April this year.   
  
One last thing, the cards have very interesting abilities, but the overall gacha design is completely hit or miss. You either get a card relevant to your current levels or you get a card that you can’t use at all (Thank you Mythic Medic 😑).
