# Clash Royale made $105M in 30 Days, Top Game After 8 Years!

[Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/)‘s Clash Royale last 30 days revenue is 🤑 $105 Mil., which is a 600% increase from its January 2025 rev, which is 50% of the whole monthly portfolio revenue making it again the Supercell biggest game 😲 after 8 years!

Yes, you read that right, its nearly 3x Brawl Stars daily revenue currently. It seems Supercell pulled another “6x revenue on an old game” trick out of its sleeve. Let’s look at the last 2 years of what was happening.  
  
▪️ In June of 2023, it introduced Card Evolutions, essentially doubling the daily revenue from 250K to 500K 🤑. This is a qualitative upgrade to some units. More units are getting these with every update. Basically recycling their unit collection for more different units created from old ones.   
  
▪️ Then in March 2024 they introduced Lucky Drops 🎰, an analogue system of Star Chest from Brawl Stars, which was during the “to the moon” phase of it scaling up. But you would just get 2 Lucky drops from daily quests, so not that impactful on economy yet.   
  
▪️ Then comes the critical update from March 2025, which removed the signature timed chest feature from the game and added 4 Lucky Drops daily instead. BUT, they also heavily nerfed the economy 📉, 𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫𝐬, no more season shop, no more gem offers, no more daily quests. You see where this is going 😅. And then comes the rocket boom of game making now, instead of $500K a day $2 Mil. a day.   
  
▪️ And yes they also added Merge Tactics on June 30th, which is a streamlined version of the killed auto chess game Clash Mini. Its great that it feeds the exact same Pass Royale progression, and you get to play with the exact same heroes as in main game, but as you see, this was not the killer feature. 𝐄𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐠𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐲 𝐃𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐬 𝐰𝐚𝐬!  
  
Join me on this special episode I did just on this topic on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎 so next time somebody asks you why this is happening, you won’t say because Merge Tactics, but because of hard economy rebalance.
