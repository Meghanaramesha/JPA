###### *The trend of 4X companies from the East diversifying into casual categories continues, as seen with Merge Episodes, DotDot Blast, and Coin Pusher.*

I’m expecting many more games to follow as the UA know-how, from the giant 4X creative teams 💡 will be utilized in casual. This can be already seen in the decoration screen in Merge Episodes, which is a screen from their creatives.  
  
The 4X war also rages on ⚔, as we see FunPlus soft launching a “summer version” of Whiteout Survival and 37Games hopping on the “4X with bugs” trend. 4X genre is the place to watch 🔍, as the onboarding iteration pushes the product to experiment with different additional core gameplay.

Again this can be seen on FunPlush portfolio, where there are already 3 different games, which are all basically a slight iteration of the same 😅.  
  
Doodle Magic is still a hot core gameplay and it is being iterated with new layers such as the Backpack hero progression. Lastly, Alien Invasion got an interesting follow-up with an Octopus version 🐙.
