###### Vertex Games’s Matching Story scaled to $300K a day after nearly 3 years in soft launch.

Is it a Match3 game or a Merge 3 game? Read the story behind this exceptional combo here 😎

It was soft-launched in May 2021 and only started scaling at the start of last year. Initially, we thought that this was a Merge game that added the Match3 core later, but this was not the case. It was a combination of Isometric Merge3 + Match3 from the initial build 😱. The Match 3 layer is basically Royal Match now, with all of its trigger events meta and collectible album, etc. But instead of a basic visual renovation progression based on stars, you get chests with merge tokens after winning Match 3 levels. Also, this is Merge 3, not Merge 5, as traditional isometric merge games do, when you merge 5 tokens instead of 6 for the same result to get more stuff. No optimization here.  
  
What this essentially does is that instead of noninteractive visual only progression of renovating a mansion 🏡 like in Gardenscapes, you have a second game in scale of Evermerge, which ads a giant amount of additional spend depth from the merging core gameplay with all of its bubble offers, exponential token growth and even characters generating tokens. You have gems for Match3 and gold for Merge3, and also let’s not forget that you can buy specific merge tokens in the shop if you are missing some chains + those permanent additional land offers staring at you every single time you start up the game 😅.  
  
So why this is will probably become the most newest successful match3 game (currently sitting at top 10 for the last month in the genre)? UA and by User Acquisition I mean “Freezing Families” 🥶. As you see in the image at the bottom, every 10 levels you have a “help” level, where you are doing some of those obvious save-the-freezing-family puzzles from the creatives, which complement their fake creatives funnel. In the current day and age, there is just no other way to scale your game. You either have this or some similar setup, or you don’t scale at all ☠️ period.
