###### Color Block Jam by [Rollic](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rollic/) scaled to $300K 🤑 a day in just 2 months 😱 Developed by [Gybe Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gybe-games/), this is another successful Hybrid-casual puzzler in Rollic’s portfolio, and we couldn’t wait to review it for you 😎

Core gameplay is deterministic puzzle, with a timer as loose condition. This is again similar to games like Twisted Tangle, where levels are not randomized and you build up your strategy in trial/error fashion. If you lose, there is literally a “Fail Offer” as per the good Hybrid puzzler standard nowadays 😅. As said, Rollic has lots of experience with this specific setup and of course Hybrid-casual puzzlers by itself, so no wonder this game is scaling like crazy currently 💹.   
  
Core idea is a great iteration on tile moving puzzles, where you have limited space to work with. The iteration is in the win condition as you need to move these pieces around the board to find a specific exit that will “shred” the blocks 😅, which is also very satisfying. Mechanics curve ramps up pretty fast with blocks that are on top of each other, frozen block, keys on top of block, 2 color blocks, etc.   
  
Of course I won’t miss the elephant 🐘 in the room and that is the visual similarity of the blocks to LEGO blocks 😅. This probably has an impact on the CPI of the game, as nostalgia hits hard of course, and LEGO is a strong brand constantly. Also the blocks behave similarly, like you would expect LEGO blocks to behave, which again ads to the overall advantages of this unique concept.
