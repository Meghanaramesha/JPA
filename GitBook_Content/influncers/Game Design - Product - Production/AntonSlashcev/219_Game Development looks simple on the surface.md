###### Game development looks simple on the surface. But this is an “Iceberg” hiding many underwater obstacles.

Above the water:  
 • Come up with a good idea  
 • Choose a game engine  
 • Create a prototype  
 • Cool logo and title  
 • Post a launch tweet  
 • Click ‘export game’  
  
Sounds straightforward, right?  
  
But the real work happens below the surface:  
  
• Gather a strong team  
 • Fun gameplay  
 • Balance progression and difficulty  
 • Optimization and bug fixes  
 • Retain players long-term  
 • Build a community  
 • Effective monetization strategy  
 • Get funding  
 • Run a successful marketing campaign  
 • Meet deadlines  
 • Bring the game to release  
 • Keep the passion for gaming alive  
 • Achieve profitability  
  
Each layer gets harder.  
Each challenge is critical.  
  
Game development isn’t just about creativity.  
It’s about perseverance, problem-solving, and commitment.  
  
Because what seems like “just a game”  
is really years of work below the surface.  
  
What part of this iceberg do you find the hardest?
