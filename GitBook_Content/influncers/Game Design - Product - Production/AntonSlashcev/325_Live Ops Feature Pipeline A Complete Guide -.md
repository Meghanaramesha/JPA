# Live Ops Feature Pipeline: A Complete Guide -

**Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:**

##### I. Pre-Production:

**1. Concept 💡**  
• Identify feature goals  
• Specify aspects to improve or develop  
• Provide references  
• Define the target audience  
• Set KPIs and profit forecasts  
  
**2. Specification 📋**  
• Describe all mechanics, states, user flow, and corner cases  
• Ensure interaction with other features  
• Prepare UI/UX mockup  
• Balance calculation  
• Team presentation  
  
**3. Planning 🗓️**  
• Scope estimation: Evaluate the scope of mechanics and art assets  
• Milestones: Define key milestones  
• Sprint planning: Break down tasks into manageable sprints  
• Risks: Identify potential risks

##### II. Production:

**4. Development 🛠️**  
• Develop feature components (code, art, UI, level design, VFX, sound, etc.)  
• Implement key parts  
• Focus on core user flow and primary use cases  
  
**5. Prototype 🧪**  
• Initial build with only key mechanics & tutorial  
• Use draft or placeholder art  
• Evaluate overall game feel and adjust vision  
  
**6. Iterations 🔄**  
• Feedback iteration: Refine the feature based on initial feedback  
• Polish mechanics  
• Create missing content  
• Clarify corner cases  
  
**7. Release Candidate 🎯**  
• Must include all content and polished mechanics  
• Only sound and minor visual effects can be placeholders  
• May not include localization  
  
**8. Quality Assurance 🧩**  
• Full QA testing: Perform comprehensive testing  
• Check interactions between features and other game mechanics  
• Evaluate from the perspective of different player groups  
  
**9. Deployment 🚀**  
• Staggered rollout: Gradually release the feature to players  
• A/B test: Compare feature variations and gather data

##### III. Post-Launch:

**10. Hotfixes 🔧**  
• Quickly address critical fixes for urgent issues  
• Adjust the number of rewards if necessary  
  
**11. Analysis 📊**  
• Data analysis: Evaluate the feature’s metrics against KPIs  
• Identify growth points and weaknesses  
• Retrospective: Discuss what went well and areas for improvement  
  
**12. Conclusions ✅**  
• Determine if you will use this feature regularly in the game  
• Assess whether the development of an improved version is required  
• Evaluate the need for a content reskin for a relaunch
