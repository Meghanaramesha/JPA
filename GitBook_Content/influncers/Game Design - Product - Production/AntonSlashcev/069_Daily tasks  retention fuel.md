𝗖𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗿𝗮𝘇𝗲 – 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀  
❌ No total task count  
❌ No update timer  
❌ Title wasted on reward text  
❌ Goal & reward unclear  
❌ Too much empty space  
❌ Progress hard to read (goal split from bar)  
  
𝗧𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗧𝗼𝘄𝗻 – 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁-𝗽𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝘂𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀  
✅ Global countdown timer  
✅ Clear goal + live progress  
✅ Two-layer reward (task + points)  
✅ Extra progressive reward bar  
✅ Accessible from main task screen

𝟰 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗮𝗸𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲-𝗼𝗽𝘀 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘀  
1. Show timer and total tasks up front  
2. Keep goal, bar, and reward in one frame  
3. Stack rewards: per task, per day, per streak  
4. Strip taps—every extra step invites churn  
  
Turn chores into habits, and habits into LTV.   
How healthy is your daily quest UI?
