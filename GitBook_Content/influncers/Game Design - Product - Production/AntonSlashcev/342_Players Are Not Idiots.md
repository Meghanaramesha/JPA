# Players Are Not Idiots!

##### I know this might sound shocking to some game developers…

**Players are not idiots!**  
  
They immediately notice when:

* You’re selling them something for $60 that isn’t even worth $10
* Your product has nothing to do with its ads
* You’re forcing them into “pay2win”
* You completely copied another game
* You didn’t test and optimize the game enough
* You didn’t finish some features and cut them out at the last moment
* You’re hiding a lack of content with tricks like reskins or tight-balancing
* You don’t care about your community

Players might not always be able to articulate exactly what is wrong.  
  
**But they ALWAYS know about it. They feel it when they play.**  
*They will react accordingly.*  
**Don’t treat players like fools. Respect your audience.**
