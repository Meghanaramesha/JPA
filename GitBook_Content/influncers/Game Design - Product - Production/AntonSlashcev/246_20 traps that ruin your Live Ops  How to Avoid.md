###### 20 traps that ruin your Live Ops (and how to avoid it)

I teamed up with [Sergei Vasiuk](/in/sergeivasjuk/) to break down the most common mistakes in Live Ops and share tips on how to improve them.  
  
• Trends  
• Events  
• Whales  
• Failures  
• Metrics  
• Content  
• Updates  
• Paywalls  
• Feedback  
• Segments  
• A/B Testing  
• Community  
• Progression  
• Onboarding  
• Radio Silent  
• Past Success  
• Monetization  
• Tech Performance  
• Customer Support  
• Cultural Relevance  
  
These elements combine to satisfy players.  
It’s where design meets player satisfaction.  
  
It’s not about perfection  
 ↳ it’s about continuous improvement.  
  
That’s the mark of a truly great game.  
A standard we can all aim for.
