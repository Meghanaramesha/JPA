Season Pass Guide

1. Players unlock them after just a few days  
2. Free and premium tracks keep engagement high  
3. Points come from regular gameplay — no grind needed   
4. Buying the pass unlocks premium rewards instantly   
5. They trigger FOMO and boost player status   
  
But here’s where it gets really interesting:  
There’s no “one-size-fits-all” — just look at the variety👇

Higher monetization.   
Deeper engagement.
