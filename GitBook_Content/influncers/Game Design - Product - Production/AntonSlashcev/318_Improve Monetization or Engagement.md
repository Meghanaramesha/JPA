# Improve Monetization or Engagement?

This is the main question when developing a new feature in Live Ops.

###### Monetization:

↳ Improve monetization to increase revenue from the player directly.

###### Examples:

• Battle Pass  
• Piggy Bank and new offers  
• Holiday Events  
• Loot Boxes  
• Casino mechanics (Roulettes, slots)  
• Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

###### **Engagement:**

↳ Improve engagement by increasing retention and/or playtime, hoping to indirectly boost revenue.

###### Examples:

• Daily Bonus  
• Win Streak  
• Social Features (Clans, Friends, Leaderboard, etc.)  
• Happy Hours  
• Meta-related Features

###### Both approaches aim to eventually improve LTV, but in different ways.

Is it possible to improve both at the same time?

In most cases, no.  
Trying to enhance both often leads to zero results.
