Why is your Day 7 retention so low?

𝟭. 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽 𝗳𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗴𝘂𝗲 🔄  
 Core loop fun for 20–30 runs, then flat.  
 • Add a new mechanic or goal every 20–30 minutes.  
 • Small surprises reset the dopamine clock.  
  
𝟮. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗮 🗺  
 No upgrades or long-term goals early.  
 • Unlock a light meta layer by Day 2: skins, narrative, pets, heroes.  
 • Show next milestone progress each session.  
  
𝟯. 𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗸𝗲𝘀 📈  
 First real fail hits too soon.  
 • Smooth difficulty: rise → micro-plateau → rise.  
 • Playtest 100-level funnel; cap early fails at < 3 tries.  
  
𝟰. 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝘁𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿 📅  
 No events or bonuses in Week 1.  
 • Ship Day 2 daily quests and win-streaks.  
 • Add a Day 3 mini-event for extra engagement.  
  
𝟱. 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹 💰  
 Players earn < spend by Day 2.  
 • Ensure “earn > spend” until Day 3.  
 • Pair any new sink with a matching faucet.  
  
𝟲. 𝗢𝗻𝗲-𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 🛤  
 Single upgrade path = boredom.  
 • Offer horizontal options: weapons, perks, décor.  
 • Let players set their own goals.  
  
𝟳. 𝗡𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗴𝗹𝘂𝗲 🤝  
 Clans and leaderboards unlock too late.  
 • Open social tab by Day 4.  
 • First clan chest drops on Day 5 to spark peer pressure.  
  
𝟴. 𝗔𝗴𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 💸  
 Too many interstitials or costly packs early.  
 • Hold hard paywalls until Day 7.  
 • Focus on rewarded ads and low-cost offers.  
  
𝟵. 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 & 𝗨𝗫 𝗲𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 🐛  
 Crashes, long loads, battery drain.  
 • Monitor Day-7 cohort logs.  
 • Target < 2% crash rate, < 1% ANR, < 5 s load.  
  
𝟭𝟬. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗳 𝗮𝘁 𝟵𝟬 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘀 🧗  
 Players clear new levels by Day 4.  
 • Feed recycled-but-remixed maps and rule twists.  
 • Schedule weekly drops alongside daily grind.  
  
𝗤𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗞𝗣𝗜 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘀:  
• D3→D7 drop < 35%  
• Avg sessions ≥ 4  
• Meta Usage Rate ≥ 60%
