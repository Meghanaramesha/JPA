64 lessons after 10 years in game development

(I wish I knew them sooner)  
  
🎮 GAME DESIGN  
 • Build around mechanics that spark curiosity  
 • Make failure a chance to learn, not just punishment  
 • Support both mastery and casual play  
 • Tie progression to gameplay, not separate systems  
  
🧠 USER EXPERIENCE  
 • Controls should feel natural, not forced  
 • Sync visuals, audio, and feedback  
 • Guide with light and color, not clutter  
 • Design should be invisible but powerful  
  
💰 MONETIZATION  
 • Sell value, not interruptions  
 • Make spending feel optional  
 • Price for perceived value, not cost  
 • Let purchases feel like upgrades, not shortcuts  
  
📊 ANALYTICS  
 • Let data guide, not dictate decisions  
 • Experiment boldly but measure carefully  
 • Understand why players leave, not just when  
 • Track what matters, not just what’s easy  
  
📣 MARKETING  
 • Speak the player’s language, not just features  
 • Don’t oversell, stay honest  
 • Hint at the experience, not just the tech  
 • Partner with creators, not just the press  
  
🛠 TEAM & PRODUCTION  
 • Align teams on why, not just how  
 • Use deadlines as guides, not hammers  
 • Celebrate small wins  
 • Creativity thrives on feedback and safe momentum  
  
⚙️ TECHNICAL OPTIMIZATION  
 • Prioritize joy, not just performance  
 • Smooth over rough edges before launch  
 • Compress smart, test harder  
 • Eliminate anything that breaks immersion  
  
🤝 COMMUNITY & LIVE OPS  
 • Build trust through transparency  
 • Reward players, not just content  
 • Surprise and delight, but don’t overwhelm  
 • Make social features matter, not just exist  
  
📈 LONG-TERM GROWTH  
 • Expand your world with merch, lore, media  
 • Let players build alongside you  
 • Use trends for inspiration, not instruction  
 • Polish is great, but it must sit on substance  
  
⚠️ PITFALLS TO AVOID  
 • Never trade player joy for quick profit  
 • Don’t explain everything, let players discover  
 • Silence does not equal satisfaction  
 • Don’t chase trends that betray your vision  
  
Every line here comes from trial, error, and a lot of late nights  
  
If you’re building games, save this  
  
And if you’ve got your own hard-earned lessons, I’d love to hear them
