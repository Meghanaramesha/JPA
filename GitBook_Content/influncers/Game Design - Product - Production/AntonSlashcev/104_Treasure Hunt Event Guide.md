###### Treasure Hunt Event Guide

Here’s a full breakdown of a treasure hunt event loop.  
  
❓ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆?  
  
 • Players dig on a grid to find hidden items.  
 • They use tools earned by playing the core game.  
 • The goal: uncover and collect all target items.  
  
🎯 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽:  
  
1. Earn pickaxes by beating core levels  
2. Enter the event via a home screen button  
3. Tap tiles to dig  
4. Reveal hidden objects or empty tiles  
5. Collect full items automatically  
6. Complete the grid → move to next stage  
7. Repeat until all stages are done  
  
🪓 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀:  
  
• Linked to main game progress  
• Harder levels = more tools  
• Give a small starting amount to everyone  
  
🧱 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱:  
  
• A tiled grid covered with “soil”  
• Hidden items (e.g. gems) placed randomly  
• Items can be different sizes (2×1, 3×3, etc.)  
• Some tiles are empty  
• Dug tiles are clearly marked  
  
🗺️ 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲:  
  
• Multiple stages (e.g. 5 in Hidden Temple)  
• Each stage has a clear goal (find X items)  
• Progress shown visually (e.g. filling a gate)  
• Later stages can be harder (bigger grids, denser items)  
  
🎁 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀:  
  
• Get prizes for each stage (chests, boosters, etc.)  
• Final reward for completing all stages  
• Mix it up: currency, consumables, cosmetics, tie-ins  
• Example: Royal Match gives items for another event (Dragon Nest)  
  
🖥️ UI and player feedback:  
  
• Clear event button on home screen  
• Short tutorial on first access  
• Info button to review rules  
• Tool counter always visible  
• Strong animations for digging and finding items  
  
⚖️ 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴:  
  
• 1 dig = 1 tool  
• Tool earning rate matches core level difficulty  
• Fair but challenging stages  
• Keep hit rate (item tiles vs. empty tiles) under control  
• Example: \~67 levels needed for full event in Royal Match  
  
🧠 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:  
  
• Link tool earnings to core game  
• Keep digging simple: tap-to-reveal  
• Use clear goals and visual cues  
• Mix reward types for excitement  
• Randomize item placement for fairness  
• Balance effort and reward
