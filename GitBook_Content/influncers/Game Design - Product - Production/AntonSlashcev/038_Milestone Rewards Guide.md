# Milestone Rewards Guide

###### 

Just created a guide on Milestone Rewards.  
  
𝟭. 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁 🎯  
• Players perform actions to earn points.  
• Like completing levels or collecting items.  
• These actions help them reach milestones.  
• Each milestone unlocks a specific reward.  
  
𝟮. 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 ✅  
• Define a clear goal for the player.  
• For example, collect 50 red “books”.  
• These items are found on regular game levels.  
  
𝟯. 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 ⚙️  
• Collected items are only counted on success.  
• If a player fails the level, they lose the items.  
• This adds a layer of challenge and risk.  
  
𝟰. 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘆 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀 🚀  
• Hard Levels grant more points per item.  
• For example, 3 points instead of 1.  
• Super Hard Levels give an even bigger boost.  
• Like a 5x multiplier on rewards.  
  
𝟱. 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 🎁  
• Offer various rewards for milestones.  
• Premium currency, boosters, unlimited lives.  
• Goals are sequential, increasing over time.  
  
𝟲. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗲 🏆  
• The final reward is a large sum of currency.  
• Goal requirements grow rapidly with each stage.  
• Players don’t see future goals in advance.  
• This tempts them to pay to speed up.
