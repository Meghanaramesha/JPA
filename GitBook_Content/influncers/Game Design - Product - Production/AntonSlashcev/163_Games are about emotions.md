###### Games aren’t just about mechanics.

They’re about emotions.  
  
Here’s how to design games that evoke emotions:  
  
🎮 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗘𝗣𝗟𝗔𝗬   
• Systems: Mechanics, core loop, difficulty  
• Emotions: Fun, curiosity, and mastery  
  
📈 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗚𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡  
• Systems: Unlocks, skill trees, rewards  
• Emotions: Anticipation, joy, and the drive to push forward  
  
🎨 𝗔𝗥𝗧 & 𝗗𝗘𝗦𝗜𝗚𝗡  
• Systems: Cohesive style, animations, characters  
• Emotions: Immersion, exploration, and game feel  
  
🖥 𝗨𝗜 & 𝗨𝗫  
• Systems: Screens, user flow, icons  
• Emotions: Intuitive understanding and smooth navigation  
  
📚 𝗧𝗨𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗜𝗔𝗟𝗦  
• Systems: Soft & hard tutorials, visual hints  
• Emotions: Competence and those satisfying “aha” moments  
  
💰 𝗠𝗢𝗡𝗘𝗧𝗜𝗭𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡  
• Systems: Offers, ads, in-game currency  
• Emotions: Balancing “pain” with fairness and value  
  
 𝗟𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗢𝗣𝗦  
• Systems: Events, leaderboards, challenges  
• Emotions: FOMO, excitement, and social engagement  
  
Don’t just build game systems.   
Build experiences players will feel.
