#### Most game choices are boring.

Too many games offer decisions that feel the same, or don’t matter at all.  
  
Great choice design makes every option meaningful.   
Here’s how to do it:  
  
𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝟯 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀  
  
😡 hot-headed – impulsive, aggressive, risky  
“I punch him to teach him respect.”  
  
🖤 cold-hearted – manipulative, self-serving  
“I lie to gain his trust, then betray him.”  
  
🤝 kind – cooperative, hopeful, resource-dependent  
“I help her now, hoping she’ll return the favor.”  
  
Each one supports a different player fantasy. All must feel viable.  
  
𝟮. 𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝘃𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀  
  
💎 premium – monetized or high-value outcomes  
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 character – select allies with gameplay/story impact  
⏳ timed–pressure choices to raise tension  
🔒 resource-locked – require stat or item thresholds  
🔁 irreversible – world-altering and permanent  
  
𝟯. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝟱 𝘁𝗶𝗽𝘀  
  
🔍 Signal clearly – foreshadow outcomes  
⚖️ Balance payoffs – mix short- and long-term rewards  
🎲 Hide variables – let small choices lead to big changes  
👀 Show consequences – make effects visible  
📊 A/B test – track and balance popular paths  
  
𝟰. 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀  
  
🧠 moral lectures – don’t preach, show results  
🕰 hard retcons – respect earlier decisions  
🚫 perfect paths – no obviously “best” choice  
🤔 opaque results – players need logic  
💰 paywall traps – premium choices should enhance, not block  
  
Great choices = clear agency + real stakes + balanced outcomes.  
  
Let players shape their own stories, and actually feel it.
