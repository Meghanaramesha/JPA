###### 

We gathered 7 steps to build engaging social features:  
  
𝟭. Core Principles 🧠  
• People play with people, not features.  
• Ensure frictionless entry methods.  
• Create mutual benefits for all.  
• Design visible status loops.  
  
𝟮. The Social Loop Anatomy 🔄  
• Discover friend activity easily.  
• Join sessions in under 10 seconds.  
• Cooperate toward shared goals.  
• Signal success with rewards.  
  
𝟯. Key Metrics to Track 📊  
• Monitor Social Activation Rate.  
• Check Group Retention Delta.  
• Aim for 3+ social sessions per DAU.  
• Compare guild members vs solos.  
  
𝟰. Build Your Feature Arsenal ⚔️  
• Create live co-op rooms.  
• Enable asynchronous gifting.  
• Implement clans and guilds.  
• Add spectator modes and reactions.  
  
𝟱. Fix Common Mistakes 🛠️  
• Never show an empty friend list.  
• Seed lists with NPC mentors.  
• Prevent toxic chat spirals.  
• Use pre-canned emotes instead.  
  
𝟲. Ask Yourself Three Questions ❓  
• Can players socialize in 3 minutes?  
• Do rewards have public showcases?  
• Will players miss out if they ignore social?  
  
𝟳. The Golden Rule 🌟  
• Design for collaboration first.  
• Save competition for later.  
• Cooperative bonds double retention.  
• Rivalry needs an existing friendship.
