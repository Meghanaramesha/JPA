In this episode of The Gaming Playbook, I sit down with Matej Lancaric, one of the most successful solopreneurs in the gaming industry, who scaled his one-person consultancy past €1.6M in revenue. Matej shares the unfiltered reality of solopreneurship: why you can’t treat it as a backup plan, how to survive the risk of losing big clients, and what it really takes to build and keep a thriving solo business.

Expect deep dives into:
- Why having a backup plan sets you up for failure
- The dangers of relying on one big client (and how to diversify)
- How to set boundaries and avoid scope creep
- The role of Substack, LinkedIn, and conferences in building trust
- Why consistency beats shortcuts every time
- Growing without turning into a traditional agency
- Building products and revenue streams on the side

Whether you’re a consultant, a service provider, or a founder considering going solo, this episode is a brutally honest masterclass on what it really takes to succeed as a 7-figure solopreneur.
