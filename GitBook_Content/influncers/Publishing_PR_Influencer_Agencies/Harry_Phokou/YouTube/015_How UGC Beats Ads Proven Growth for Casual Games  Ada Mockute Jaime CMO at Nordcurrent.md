In this episode, I sit down with Ada Mockute Jaime, CMO at Nordcurrent (Cooking Fever, Airplane Chefs) to unpack what’s actually working in mobile game marketing in 2025.

From UGC that turns into billion-view ads, to TikTok Lives that really convert to installs, Ada breaks down the tactics casual studios can copy tomorrow to scale faster and cheaper.

We cover:

- How to turn organic UGC into high-performing Spark Ads
- Why TikTok Lives do drive installs (and how to track it)
- What gameplay actually drives views: fast, chaotic clips that hook instantly
- Why Discord isn’t always the right community hub
- Smarter brand collabs: from Puma drops to QR “secret menus”

Whether you’re a marketer, game developer, or just curious how mobile games reach millions of players, this episode breaks down the strategies shaping game marketing in 2025.
