# Ex VC-exec: Why Most Game Studios Are Scaling the Expensive Way | Ridzki Syahputera

Think raising VC is the best way to grow a game? Think again.

In this episode, I sit down with Ridzki Syahputera — ex-VC and co-founder of PVX Partners — to unpack the truth about game funding, marketing, and scaling in 2025.

Whether you're building your first game or working at a studio, this is the stuff nobody teaches: how user acquisition really works, when to raise money (and when to avoid it), and what separates games that scale from games that stall.

We break down:

- The hidden cost of equity (and how to avoid it)
- ROAS benchmarks from 350+ studios
- Smarter ways to fund growth — without giving up ownership
- What VCs and publishers actually look for

Whether you're building a hit, running a studio, or just serious about games as a business, this episode will change how you think about growth.
