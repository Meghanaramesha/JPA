Hypercasual Games Hit a Wall in 2023
Hypercasual, the fastest-growing genre since 2018, experienced its first download decline in 2023 due to new privacy regulations. Despite this setback, modest growth is still expected in the coming years.
Leading game genres like Match (7.4% CAGR), Puzzle (6.9% CAGR), and Kids (6.4% CAGR) are projected to have the highest growth rates.

Android phone usage shifts towards apps over games. App usage surged by nearly a trillion hours from 2020 to 2023, while mobile game time dropped by 100 billion hours. This trend is projected to persist, with apps growing at a 5.0% CAGR, surpassing games’ 2.4% CAGR. Gaming time growth is especially restricted in China due to regulations, particularly for younger users.
