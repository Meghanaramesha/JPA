Welcome toBlack Mirror: Thronglets, the brand-new mobile game launching alongside the latest season ofBlack Mirroron Netflix. Inspired by the episodePlaything, this isn’t your average nostalgia trip. It’s a dark dive into digital affection, emotional manipulation, and what happens when your virtual pet wants something more than just snacks.
Seen the episode?You already know the vibe.Haven’t yet?Sad.
When Andrea Jacobson pitched the idea of turningPlaything’s fictional game into reality, we were all in. Who could resist a project that turns childhood comfort into high-tech dread?
Thronglets starts out sweet. It’s cute. Quirky. Even lovable.Then it gets curious.+ Gets clingy.
