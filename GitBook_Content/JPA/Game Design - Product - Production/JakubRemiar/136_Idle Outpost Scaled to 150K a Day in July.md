# Idle Outpost Scaled to $150K a Day in July

Idle Outpost 🧟‍♀️ by [Rockbite Games Armenia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rockbite-games/) published by [AppQuantum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/appquantum/) already scaled to $150K a day in July 🤑.

###### With more than 10 Million downloads and $6 Mil. IAP revenue behind it, (Ads are probably more than 50% on top of this 😅) we couldn’t miss this very interesting iteration on 2 of our favorite games.

Can you guess which ones? 😎

As seen in the images, Idle Outpost is a clever combination of Lessmore’s Eatventure and JoyNet Games’s Legend of Mushroom 🍄. Instead of food, you are selling supplies to other Zombie Apocalypse “customers” 💲 and you keep finding survivor gear with your trusty dog on the way through Zombie Wasteland. I keep saying this all the time, but the Zombie theme works with everything and makes your CPI low 🤣 “change my mind”.  
  
Because you are playing 2 idle cores in parallel the game demands an astounding amount of engagement, which is an interesting solution to fix the stuckness of the Idle genre. Because if you get stuck in the first one (upgrade costs get too high) you move to the next one where power progression is based on HP/DMG scaling and if bosses get too strong there, you go back to the first one. I think the game could use a little bit longer onboarding as unlocking 10+ different currencies in 2 days (basically 2 separate games) is a little bit too much for the Western user 😅.  
  
There are also some very interesting iterations, which fix some of the issues of the previous games such as the turn-based auto-combat system, which is also PvP, level design of the “restaurants”, gear recipes, profit stacking, etc. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matejlancaric/) & [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎 a great job [Rockbite Games Armenia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rockbite-games/) for being able to create this interesting combo!
