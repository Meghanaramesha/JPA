###### Review Radar #6 📡 is back with 13 games that we already covered on the podcast in the last 3 months, as we keep them on our “radar” 😅. Get the latest status updates from big names such as [Peak](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peak/), [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/), [Zynga](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zynga/), [Netmarble](https://www.linkedin.com/company/netmarble-games/), [miHoYo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mihoyo/), [AppQuantum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/appquantum/), [ABI Game Studio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/abi-games-pte-ltd/), [Space Ape Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/space-ape-games/), 😎.

[Peak](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peak/) game’s Match Factory hasn’t peaked 😅 yet and is still scaling up scoring the studio a hattrick of 3rd successful big hit 😁. On the other hand, both Wood Nuts & Bolts and Chrome Valley customs are scaling down, probably because of the fierce opposition from Century Games’s Truck Star 🚚 for the latter. The Banana Steam game is still keeping around 350K average monthly CCU as it seems bot farms just won’t let go of this dream to waste 😅🤖.  
  
Supercell’s SquadBusters is keeping stable numbers, with continuous frequent iteration, with the Star Chest ⭐ system being the latest metagame addition. The same goes for miHoYo’s Zenless Zone Zero, which is keeping up its usual 3-week content treadmill with stable performance. Korean hits are also still killing it, with Lucky Defense adding finally a new character and [TREEPLLA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/treeplla/)‘s Office Cat CEO still being more rich 🤑. Join us as we discuss all of these games with [Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/)& [Felix Braberg](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/) 😎.
