# Uma Musume Pretty Derby: Daily $300K IAPs & 80K Downloads

Uma Musume Pretty Derby 🏇 is currently doing $300K a day with 80K downloads a day just with English versions 😮. Why is this the best rogue-lite game ever made?

Finally the Japanese hit, which earned more than $2.5 Bil. mainly in Japan was released in English last month, 4 years after its release in 2021. It’s an iteration of an arcade game Derby Owners Club 🐎 by Sega released in 1999. Actually all of the horse girls are direct references to real life horses together with all the tracks and mechanics of the game. This gives the game amazing real world authenticity. No wonder [Small Giant Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/small-giant-games/) already tried to clone this.  
  
But the main success is its unique gameplay, that is like no other game on the market currently. You train your horse girl during 3 years of her career as she takes on races. Each horse girl requires different strategies and each has her own special objectives. You can only control the decisions between races and racing is completely automatic, you can even skip it to results all together. As she finishes career she becomes a veteran and this is where the magic starts.   
  
You will need 2 veteran horse girls as “parents” for your next run, they have a chance to “inspire” your new trainee with stats and skills. This is the part where your previous run directly affects your next run, which perfectly ties them together as you literally want to create “perfect parents” for different situations. You see where this is going 😁
