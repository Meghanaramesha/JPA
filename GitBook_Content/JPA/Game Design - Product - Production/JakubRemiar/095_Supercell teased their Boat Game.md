# Supercell teased their “Boat Game”

###### Yesterday [Supercell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supercell/) teased their new game called “Boat Game” ⛵ in a very cryptic video of gameplay and random images. There is also a hidden message in the video I am sure Internet will decode by now 😅. So what is Boat game about?

On the surface look it looks like a simplification of Sea of Thieves ☠️, the pirate hit from [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/). We can see that there will be 2 core gameplays, one for the naval combat with completely different abilities and one for the land combat 🔫. Again with different set of abilities. Both controlled by the typical virtual joystick on the left and ability buttons on the right control scheme. Both cores seems to have their separate inventories as seen in the image of Gear & Boat buttons. I am guessing both will be based on gacha progression.   
  
The Brain 🧠 button leads to passive skill tree, with some basic stats skills and more advanced ability unlocks it seems. There is a screen during the video, which indicates the selection of drop zones, similar to Fortnite style game start. This could indicate that the game would be a battle royale experience with survival elements such as building and weapon scavenging.   
  
Overall it seems the game will be pretty core, as just on the surface look it will have big learning cap to know all of this, map awareness and aiming element required to play. Keep in mind that you aim differently with the parabolic cannonballs 💣 of your ship and with the crosshairs of your gun. But as always, Supercell is the master of “take what works and make it better”. You can already register for the Alpha test through their page. We can’t wait with [[Matej 🦩](/in/matejlancaric/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA27RCYBolGlkJ9FxuKw5RfgtXCEXzxqslA) & [[Felix](/in/felix-braberg-7a732b51/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArnpK8BJQauPullIeKCtAxunX451Gme5_I) to review this bold iteration 😁.
