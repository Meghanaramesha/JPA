###### Review Radar #7 📡 is back with 15 games that we already covered on the podcast in last 3 months, as we keep them on our “radar” 😅.

Reelshort continues to scale, breaking $31 Mil. for last month January 🤑 Pokémon TCG Pocket released the second set which mean they did $70 Mil. in last 30 days 💹, steady on its way to $1 Bil. after 12 months from launch.   
Homa finally started to scale up All in Hole, making $3,5 Mil. just from IAPs 😅 last 30 Days. Lastly both Impulse and Colorwood Sort are continuing to take on scale in the winner bracket 😁.   
  
On the looser bracket, Valve’s Deadlock has run out of “steam” 😅 as its CCU plunged. Elder Scrolls Castles is basically dead ☠️. Age of Empires Mobile will be soon dead. Cup Heroes, Balatro Mobile 🃏 and My Supermarket simulator 3D are slowly declining. Capybara GO and HexaSort are getting pretty stable, but not scaling anymore. Offline Games no Wifi Games was able to stabilize at around 11 Mil. downloads a month, in the end an outstanding outcome after the initial craze.
