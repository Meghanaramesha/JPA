# Global games market at $188 billion this year, Mobile still leads

[Newzoo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newzoo/)’s 2025 outlook puts the global games market at $188.8 Bil. this year, +3.4% YoY. Mobile still leads 📱, but the fastest growth is shifting to console as new hardware cycles, stronger release calendars, and pricing dynamics kick in. (I wonder if they factored in all the Web shop mobile revenue? 😅)

▪️ 📱 𝐌𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐞 $103.0B 55% share, +2.9%  
▪️ 🎮 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐞 $45.9B 24% share +5.5%   
▪️ 🖥️ 𝐏𝐂 $39.9B 21% share +2.5%   
  
▪️ The narrative is moving from volume to value: fewer, bigger titles anchoring spend on console/PC, while mobile increasingly leans on direct-to-consumer models beyond (E.g. the web shops 🤑)   
  
▪️ APAC remains the engine at $87.6 Bil. (46% share), with LATAM and Middle East & Africa growing the fastest (because of the lowest base of course 😅) The two big markets: China ($49.8B) and the U.S. ($49.6B) account for nearly half of all consumer spend.   
  
▪️ As for the player base, its 3.58 Bil. in 2025, dominated by mobile, while console and PC remain meaningful but mature.   
  
▪️ Newzoo forecasts $206.5 Bil. by 2028, with console leading growth (The big bet is obviously on GTA VI killing it next year 💥)   
  
So whets next? Get ready for more Chinese games trying to conquer more genres on mobile, more AI headlines, hopefully some actually positive, more cross platform and UGC focused ecosystems and even more crazy fake ads UA now powered by gen AI.
