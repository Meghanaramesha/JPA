# Zenless Zone Zero by miHoYo: $50M in 3 Weeks

##### Zenless Zone Zero by [miHoYo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mihoyo/) already went past $50 Million in the first 3 weeks 🤑

**Just on mobile with more than 12 Million Downloads, still doing around $1 Million a day on mobile only.**

##### How does it compare to the other portfolio titles?

We see the winning formula of miHoYo being in use here again, where the tried and tested metagame gacha progression is the same as with Genshin and HSR. Again as with HSR, there is a different core gameplay, where here we have a fast-paced visceral hack-and-slash style points combat ⚔. What could go wrong here? It seems not everything is going according to the plan.  
  
The combat itself is the biggest highlight of the game, but it is unfortunately buried under loads of additional loops, that don’t add that much value to the overall power progression. The most controversial feature, the TV screen 📺 minigame during missions, which replaced the 3D environment walking between encounters in HSR hasn’t been iterated from the Beta that much, despite negative feedback.

There was a speed-up ⏭ button added, which could indicate that developers are aware, that the feature slows down the flow of the game, but this isn’t enough. Spending 10% of the time in combat and 90% of time in the TV screen mode seems as the biggest issue of the game currently.  
  
Looking at the previous games’ first 30 days mobile revenue numbers, it seems Zzz will have the lowest of the 3 📉.

This doesn’t mean everything is over, but the main indicator of the game’s health will be the revenue spikes during the next few gacha cycles 🤔

All 3 games follow a specific content cadence pipeline, which introduces new characters every 3 weeks, where revenue spikes drastically. I guess after 2 or 3 additional cycles we will see what the real revenue profile of the game will look like.
