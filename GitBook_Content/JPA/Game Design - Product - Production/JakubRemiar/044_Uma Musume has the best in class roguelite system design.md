Warning ☢️ Heavy Game Design podcast ahead. Uma Musume has the best in class roguelite system design, which is confirmed by its surprising growth in the west as the game already passed $400K a day on English versions only 🤑.

No other Roguelite game on the market gets even close to how the rogue-lite legacy system works in Uma Musume. It is based on the principle that once you finish training your horse girl, she became a veteran and her “inheritance” benefits, called sparks, roll. This is random for each of the 3 types of sparks – Main stat Blue, Affinity Pink, and extra white sparks of additional skills and stat boost. This essentially means that after every run you have a chance to create a perfect “parent” for your trainee on the next run. Even though you made all the right decisions and you won every race 🏇 on your run, randomness can still take you down, and your parent will be mediocre at best. This is similar to how gear stat are rolled on RPG gear in games like Diablo or Genshin Impact.   
  
You just want the perfect combination of stats of Critical Chance, Critical Strike, Attack Speed, etc. This is exactly same system but on steroids. For instance, to even be able to roll a 3 star blue spark speed stat you actually need to have the stat at the end of the run at 1100 out of 1200 so nearly maximum and you still only have 10% chance to get a 3 star, assuming it rolls speed through 1 out of 5 main stats in the first place 🎲. You see where this is going, and we just started 😅. You then need a good pink spark roll and white sparks rolls are given based on you having skills or winning races, there is around 60 of those that you want to get. And we are still only at 1 parent out of 6!!! 😲 as both parents and grandparents count 😅   
  
Ultimately, this creates a perfect system where every run counts, but still can get hampered by randomness, so its basically gacha based rewards progress. Similarly to dropping legendary gear in RPG you get “legendary” veteran horse girls who rolled those perfect stats. At least you can “borrow” 1 parent 3 times a day through friends mechanic. I think that this system is super strong not only because of its nearly infinite replay ability factor, but also minimum content creation demands, as the game doesn’t need to create new levels, monsters, power layers, pretty much just ads some new horse girls as they will still race the same tracks. Join me on this special [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast episode, where I go super deep about this system 😎.
