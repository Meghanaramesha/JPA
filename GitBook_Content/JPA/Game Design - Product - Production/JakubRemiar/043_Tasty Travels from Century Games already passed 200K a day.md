Tasty Travels from [Century Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/century-game/) has already passed $200K 🤑 a day in revenue and they are not slowing down. How is it possible that a new merge2 game done by 4X company is scaling so fast?

We finally reviewed the game on our podcast and I must say I am positively surprised. Even though the game itself is basically 80% Travel Town, it still has some tricks up its sleeve to top the competition. There are a lot of quality of life upgrades such as directly linking tokens from the store shop 🛒 into the core loop or having an overview screen of the sticker album. But in order to beat Travel Town you need much more than that. It seems to me that there are 2 attack ⚔️ vectors that they will be trying to surpass the original – LiveOps events + User Acquisition.   
  
We have seen already what Century Games did, when they completely took over Chrome Valley Customs (the male oriented match3) with their version called Truck Star 🚚. Every single mentioned game here is using the Royal Match events meta but Century iterated upon it and added new types of events with their custom flavor. And I think they will do the same for Tasty Travels as I have already seen few of those.   
  
The other front is UA – they already implemented Fruit Merge 🍉 into the game as minigame and you could have guessed that they are heavily using it in their ad creatives. So they follow the now standard fake ads mitigation product funnel, where it won’t be “fake anymore” as you can actually play it in the game, even though its gameplay impact is nonexistent 😅. In the end it is Century Games, which are now running 2 top 4X games, which both use this bait and switch setup of luring you in on a game in creatives and then pulling a 4X on you.   
  
This whole genre seems like a big UA war now, and it will most probably end up the same as in 4X where we see Century vs Rivergame having a very fierce fight over the genre market share. Now we have Microfun (another Chinese giant) being challenged by Century Games itself. Its gonna be a packed second half of the year for merge genre. Join us as we talk about all of this with [Matej 🦩](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA27RCYBolGlkJ9FxuKw5RfgtXCEXzxqslA) & [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAArnpK8BJQauPullIeKCtAxunX451Gme5_I) on the [two & a half gamers](https://www.linkedin.com/company/two-a-half-gamers/) podcast 😎.
