###### Adventure/Expedition events are one of the most engaging features.

𝟭. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽   
 • Players explore a special event map using point-and-click controls   
 • Progress requires “event energy” to remove obstacles and collect resources   
 • The map is revealed section by section as obstacles are cleared   
  
𝟮. 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴   
 • Each event begins with a dynamic intro video   
 • Characters deliver dialogue during milestones   
 • Players can skip—but most stay for the story   
  
𝟯. 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻   
 • Tasks are grouped into chapters   
 • Players can complete tasks in any order   
 • Completing all tasks in a chapter unlocks new content and rewards   
  
𝟰. 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 & 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀   
 • Key items are scattered across the map   
 • Players gather, combine, and redeem them for prizes   
 • Some objectives require building or repairing key structures   
  
𝟱. 𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀   
 • “Dynamite” clears multiple obstacles at once   
 • Bonus energy found in storage boxes across the map   
 • Super hard core levels grant more energy   
  
𝟲. 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻   
 • Energy is earned through core gameplay   
 • Tied to the game’s narrative and main progression   
 • Drives deeper engagement across the full experience   
  
𝟳. 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀   
 • Players can purchase extra energy or boosters   
 • Both real currency and in-game currency are supported   
  
𝟴. 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱   
 • A unique prize is revealed at the start   
 • Completing all event locations unlocks it   
  
Expedition Events work because they blend exploration, storytelling, and challenge, without overwhelming players.  
  
Inspired by Klondike Adventures and Family Island, but shaped by your world.
