###### Playtesting can make or break your game.

Here’s a simple 10-step checklist:  
  
𝟭. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀   
• What are you testing? Mechanics, pacing, difficulty, UI?   
• Set clear goals and decide how you’ll measure success.  
  
𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁   
• Use a stable build or prototype.   
• Provide clear instructions or a tutorial.   
• Remove distractions and get tools ready (feedback forms, screen recorders, analytics).  
  
𝟯. 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀   
• Include your target audience, plus some outsiders and experts.   
• Mix skill levels (kids, casual players, hardcore gamers).   
• Set expectations and communicate session details.  
  
𝟰. 𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲   
• Focused tests to dive deep into specific features.   
• Blind tests to observe natural behavior.   
• Exploit tests to see how easily things can break.  
  
𝟱. 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀   
• Don’t guide or coach, just brief them.   
• Let players fail to find real issues.   
• Ask for honest, specific feedback.   
• Set clear session duration and boundaries.  
  
𝟲. 𝗢𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻   
• Watch for confusion, frustration, delight.   
• Only intervene if they’re totally stuck.   
• Ask open-ended questions like:   
 “What were you trying to do here?”   
 “What did you find confusing?”  
  
𝟳. 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸   
• Do interviews or surveys after the session.   
• Track hard data (retry counts, completion time, stuck points).   
• Compare what they say to what they did.  
  
𝟴. 𝗦𝗽𝗼𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀   
• Look for repeated issues or themes.   
• Prioritize the most critical fixes.   
• Align changes with your game’s vision.  
  
𝟵. 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗴𝗮𝗶𝗻   
• Fix the biggest pain points first.   
• Retest to catch anything new.   
• Bring in both new and returning testers.  
  
𝟭𝟬. 𝗟𝗼𝗴 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴   
• Track every change in a shared doc.   
• Compare feedback across builds.   
• Note what worked and what didn’t.   
• Keep it all for future learning.  
  
Playtesting isn’t just a phase.   
It’s a mindset.   
Make it part of your process from day one.
