###### 10 Live Ops traps to avoid

I teamed up with [[Sergei](/in/sergeivasjuk/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA0ct24BPorcmzlTJC8mJW7OuV5zOnyKfuI) to break down the most common mistakes in Live Ops and share tips on improving them:  
  
1. Over-focusing on a single metric 📊   
Track retention, engagement, and happiness—not just revenue.   
  
2. Event overload 🔄   
Too many events burn players out. Space them out.   
  
3. Copy-paste strategies 📋   
What worked before might not work now. Adapt and test.   
  
4. Ignoring feedback 🗣️   
Complaints = insights. Use them to catch problems early.   
  
5. Over-relying on whales 🐋   
Cater to all players, not just big spenders.   
  
6. Content drought 🌵   
No new content? Players leave. Keep it fresh.   
  
7. Inconsistent updates ⏰   
No schedule = frustrated players. Be reliable.   
  
8. Misusing A/B testing ⚖️   
Bad tests, bad data. Test properly to improve.   
  
9. Weak onboarding 🛠️   
Confusion = churn. Make onboarding fun and clear.   
  
10. Early paywalls 💰   
Let players enjoy the game before monetizing.   
  
Which trap do you see most often?
