# Mobile Game Unit Economy

*Let’s break down the math behind profitable scaling.*  
𝟭. The Golden Rule ⚖️  
• LTV must always exceed CPI  
• Earn more per user than you spend  
• If LTV > CPI, you can scale safely  
• If not, you are burning cash  
  
𝟮. Money In (Revenue) 💸  
• Combine IAA (Ads) and IAP (Purchases)  
• Utilize rewarded ads and interstitials  
• Sell starter bundles and season passes  
• Monetize with skins and consumables  
  
𝟯. Money Out (Costs) 📉  
• Always subtract the 30% platform fee  
• Account for UA spend and taxes  
• Include OPEX like servers and support  
• Factor in development costs (CAPEX)  
  
𝟰. Essential KPIs 📊  
• Retention measures game stickiness  
• ARPDAU tracks daily value per user  
• Conversion % shows free-to-payer rate  
• CPI measures the health of UA  
  
𝟱. The Funnel Math 🧮  
• Calculate gross vs. net revenue  
• Track how fast you earn back spend  
• Aim for positive ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)  
• Ensure payback periods are sustainable  
  
𝟲. Growth Levers 🚀  
• Raise LTV by boosting retention  
• Cut CPI with sharper ad creatives  
• Target high-value geos to improve yield  
• Shorten payback with Day-1 offers  
  
𝟳. Health Checks 🩺  
• Monitor ARPDAU and crashes daily  
• Review LTV vs. CPI weekly  
• Analyze long-term retention monthly  
• Watch for red flags like <30% D1
