# Mobile game design is mostly dead.

#### Mobile game design is mostly dead.

90% of game design tasks today are “copy this from Royal Match”.  
  
Sorry, but that’s NOT game design.  
At best, it’s reverse engineering.  
(at worst – it’s theft).  
  
And look, I get it.  
Studying competitors is smart.  
Understanding why a mechanic works? Even smarter.  
  
But copying blindly?  
That kills innovation.  
And it ignores the most important question:  
  
𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿?  
  
Great game design starts with the player experience.  
Not with a top-grossing chart.  
  
Yes, sometimes the best solution looks similar to what’s already out there.  
But sometimes it means doing the complete opposite.  
  
If your entire strategy is low-budget imitation,  
you’ll always be behind the games you’re copying.  
  
Want proof?  
Look at Royal Match.  
  
 • They’re not winning because they copy others.  
 • They’re winning because they can’t.  
 • There’s no one to follow – so they experiment.  
 • They build. They try. They \*invent\*.  
  
And that’s what sets them apart.
