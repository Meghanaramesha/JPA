###### How to choose the right game publisher?

Together with [Yodo1 Games](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yodo1/), we gathered a quick guide to get it right:  
  
1. Match your game’s genre to the publisher’s strengths.  
2. Know their approach: boutique vs. mass-market.  
3. Align clearly on KPI expectations.  
4. Look beyond user acquisition: find co-development support.  
5. Clearly define your expectations upfront:  
 • Revenue share   
 • Investment needs  
 • Exclusivity terms  
 • Build frequency  
   
  
Tips for successful collaboration 🤝:  
  
• Trust your Publishing Manager or switch if necessary.  
• Align on launch plans and KPIs.  
• Get early feedback, but trust your vision.  
• Carefully negotiate contract terms.  
• Leverage your strengths to improve terms.  
• Check their reputation with other studios.  
• Schedule weekly meetings and ensure transparent reporting.
