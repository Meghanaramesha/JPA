###### 

Just made guide on how to fix the 5 most common tutorial mistakes that cause players to churn.  
  
𝟭. No Clear Player Promise ❓  
• You teach controls before answering “Why care?”  
• This causes players to drop off early.  
• Fix: Start with a fantasy or a big payoff.  
• Fix: Give an upgrade in the first minute.  
• Fix: Teach controls inside a meaningful scene.  
  
𝟮. Wall-of-Text “Teaching” 📖  
• Text boxes, arrows, and slides replace actual gameplay.  
• This leads to low skill gain and high quit rates.  
• Fix: Show, don’t tell. Use playable micro-lessons.  
• Fix: Teach one verb per screen (move → aim → act).  
• Fix: Use skill checks that require successful action.  
  
𝟯. Cognitive Overload 🤯  
• You introduce too many systems and terms too soon.  
• This leads to confusion, misclicks, and churn.  
• Fix: Introduce only one new system per level or room.  
• Fix: Cut any step that isn’t absolutely necessary.  
• Fix: Use consistent names and icons for ideas.  
  
𝟰. One-Size-Fits-All Tutorial 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  
• Veterans get bored with hand-holding.  
• Novices get lost and confused.  
• Fix: Branch the tutorial by player skill.  
• Fix: Offer a “Skip” option for experienced players.  
• Fix: Provide optional “Help” for novices.  
  
𝟱. No Bridge to the Live Game 🌉  
• The tutorial ends on a dead screen with no next step.  
• Players finish learning and then churn before session 2.  
• Fix: End the tutorial in a real level with live stakes.  
• Fix: Set a clear “Day 1 goal” for the player.  
• Fix: This could be a 10-15 min quest chain.
