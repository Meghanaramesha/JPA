# Getting a Game Dev Degree is the WORST use of time and money.

###### 

By graduation, the way we make games will change.  
Theory goes out of date the day you learn it.  
  
You might say there’s a timeless “foundation.”  
My take – there is only one rule: fun is king.   
That’s it.  
  
Beyond that, there’s no universal law in design, UX, engineering, or art.  
Games aren’t like movies or books. They’re wildly diverse:  
  
 • Casual puzzles with thousands of tuned levels  
 • Visual novels with tons of text and choices  
 • “Friendslops” with ugly-fun multiplayer  
 • AAA photoreal blockbusters  
 • Walking sims with notes  
 • Cozy pixel platformers  
 • Tic-tac-toe  
  
… and a million other games  
  
Each year, trends, tastes, and tools shift.  
So “immutable” principles rarely hold for long.  
  
The only way to build real skill?   
Make games constantly.  
Prototype nonstop.   
Vary approaches, mechanics, and metas.  
  
And you don’t need a university for that:  
  
 • Watch YouTube tutorials  
 • Ask ChatGPT  
 • Install Unity, Unreal, or Godot  
 • Start experimenting  
 • Participate in game jams  
 • Work on pet projects  
  
Start simple.   
Then go bigger.  
The key skill is continually finding new ways to make fun games.
