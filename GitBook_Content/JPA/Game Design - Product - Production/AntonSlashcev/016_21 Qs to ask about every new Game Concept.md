# 21 Qs to ask about every new Game Concept

###### 21 questions to ask about every new game concept:

1. CORE GAMEPLAY 🎮  
 • What actions will the player perform over and over?   
 • What are the clear win / lose conditions?  
   
2. DIFFICULTY 🔥  
 • What prevents players from acting, and how do those obstacles evolve?  
   
3. FUN FACTOR 😄  
 • Which moment-to-moment action feels so good that you’d do it even without objectives?  
   
4. MOTIVATION 🎯  
 • What long-term goal pulls players through challenges?  
   
5. VARIETY 🎲  
 • Which fresh mechanics or twists appear as the game progresses, and are they paced to avoid fatigue?  
   
6. PLAYER PROGRESSION 📈  
 • Which systems visibly signal growth—XP, gear, narrative beats, cosmetics?  
   
7. SKILL MASTERY 🏆  
 • How are razor-sharp execution and deep understanding rewarded?  
   
8. NARRATIVE 📖  
 • Is there a story, theme, or emotional arc that amplifies key moments?  
   
9. MARKETABILITY 📣  
 • Can a 5-second GIF sell the loop? Can you pitch the concept in one sticky sentence?  
   
10. WOW FACTOR 🌟  
 • What surprise will players brag about compared with genre peers?  
   
11. SOCIAL INTERACTION 🗣  
 • How will players cooperate, compete, or flex achievements to drive organic growth?  
   
12. MONETIZATION 💰  
 • What will players willingly pay for, and how does spending enhance—never gate—core play?  
   
13. RETENTION HOOKS 🔄  
 • Which daily, weekly, or seasonal loops keep the community returning?  
   
14. ACCESSIBILITY  
 • Can people with different skills, devices, or abilities enjoy the game without friction?  
   
15. SESSION DESIGN ⏳  
 • How long is a typical session, and does the loop respect both “snack” and “meal” play styles?  
   
16. TECHNICAL RELIABILITY ⚙️  
 • Will performance, controls, and load times feel rock-solid on target devices?  
   
17. ANALYTICS & ITERATION 📊  
 • Which metrics shape decisions from day one, and how does player feedback feed the roadmap?  
   
18. CONTROLS 🎛  
 • Are inputs intuitive and responsive—especially on touch screens—and can core actions be executed with one hand?  
   
19. PLATFORM FIT 📱  
 • Does the design leverage each platform’s strengths (haptics, sensors, cloud saves) while respecting constraints?  
   
20. CONTENT PIPELINE 📦  
 • How will you deliver fresh levels, characters, and live-ops events at a sustainable cadence?  
   
21. COMMUNITY FEEDBACK 👥
