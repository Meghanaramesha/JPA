###### 

Just gathered the fundamental principles for creating engaging and memorable games.  
  
𝟭. Put the Player Promise First 🎯  
• Define the core player fantasy in one sentence.  
• What do I get to be?  
• What do I get to do?  
• Every single feature must serve this promise.  
  
𝟮. Clarity Beats Cleverness 💡  
• Players should understand goals and controls instantly.  
• Make feedback clear and immediate.  
• Remove all ambiguity first.  
• Then you can add depth.  
  
𝟯. Teach by Doing 👆  
• Tutorials should be playable levels, not lectures.  
• Introduce a concept (telegraph).  
• Let the player test it.  
• Reward them quickly, within 30 seconds.  
  
𝟰. Agency over Automation 🕹️  
• Give players meaningful choices.  
• Present real trade-offs, not obvious best picks.  
• Choices must affect the outcome.  
• Go beyond simple cosmetic changes.  
  
𝟱. Fair Challenge, Readable Failure 💔  
• Players must understand why they failed.  
• Show them how they can improve.  
• Punish time, not the player’s dignity.  
• Make recovery feel close and achievable.  
  
𝟲. Depth from Simple Rules 🧩  
• Start with a few simple rules or actions.  
• Create many possible interactions.  
• Allow systems to combine in unexpected ways.  
• This creates emergent, deep gameplay.  
  
𝟳. Consistency with Delightful Exceptions ✨  
• Establish stable rules to build player trust.  
• Surprises should work within these rules.  
• You can break a rule once for dramatic effect.  
• Make sure to foreshadow it first.  
  
𝟴. Reward Curiosity and Mastery 🔍  
• Reward players for exploring the world.  
• Rewards should offer real utility, not just trinkets.  
• Skill improvement should increase efficiency.  
• It’s not just about bigger numbers.  
  
𝟵. Listen, Measure, Iterate 📊  
• Use playtests and data to guide your decisions.  
• Don’t let your ego get in the way.  
• Be ruthless when cutting features that don’t work.  
• Add new features sparingly and with purpose.
