###### Most games fail because they focus on the wrong things.

Players don’t quit because your game isn’t big enough.   
  
They quit because it isn’t fun enough.  
  
Here’s what most devs try (and what actually works):  
  
𝟭. 𝗧𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗻   
↳ What devs try:   
• Fancy graphics   
• Huge open worlds   
• Long cinematics   
  
↳ What works:   
• One core mechanic that feels great from minute one   
  
𝟮. 𝗧𝗼 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱   
↳ What devs try:   
• Random freebies   
• Tons of side chores   
• Endless notifications   
  
↳ What works:   
• A clear gameplay loop that rewards skill and curiosity   
  
𝟯. 𝗧𝗼 𝗯𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘆   
↳ What devs try:   
• Surprise “gotcha” moments   
• Just big numbers   
• Easy tutorial, then huge spike   
  
↳ What works:   
• Gradual challenges, small setbacks, and meaningful wins   
  
𝟰. 𝗧𝗼 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆   
↳ What devs try:   
• Forced big co-op events   
• Leaving players clueless   
• Ignoring feedback   
  
↳ What works:   
• Friendly systems like guilds and small competitions   
• Clear guidance and a positive culture   
  
𝟱. 𝗧𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝗿𝗹𝘆   
↳ What devs try:   
• Overpriced loot boxes   
• Pop-ups every 5 seconds   
• Pay-to-win   
  
↳ What works:   
• Optional, high-value purchases that don’t break the game   
  
𝟲. 𝗧𝗼 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗶𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵   
↳ What devs try:   
• Reskinning old content   
• “Endless” mode   
• Random events   
  
↳ What works:   
• Data-driven LiveOps that responds to real player behavior   
  
The pattern is clear:   
Players don’t need more.   
They need better.
