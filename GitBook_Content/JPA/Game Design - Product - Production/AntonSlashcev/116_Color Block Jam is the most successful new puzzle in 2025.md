Color Block Jam is the most successful new puzzle in 2025.

• $44M lifetime revenue  
• 33M downloads  
• +17,000% growth  
  
So what’s the game?  
  
A colorful 3D puzzle in the block & slide subgenre.  
  
• Move blocks to their matching exits  
• Blocks block each other (pun intended)  
• Limited time, logic-based challenges  
• Swipe or drag-and-drop controls  
  
It’s like LEGO meets logic meets urgency.  
  
What makes it work?  
  
1. Onboarding is light.  
 Just a quick tutorial. Then it’s all player-led discovery.  
  
2. Progression is smart.  
 12 intro levels, then menu loop, regular new mechanics, harder levels.  
  
3. Monetization blends ads + in-apps:  
 • Watch ads to earn coins  
 • Spend coins on boosters  
 • Buy infinite lives, coins, and boosters  
  
Popular boosters include:  
• Freeze Time  
• Hammer  
• Vacuum  
• +20s post-booster  
  
This game competes with big names:  
• Farm Jam (animals)  
• Traffic Escape (cars)  
• Block Blast (Tetris-style)  
  
But stands out with minimal UI, 3D clarity, and spatial puzzles that feel satisfying to solve.  
  
Hybrid-casual puzzle games are still thriving.  
  
Color Block Jam is the latest reminder.
