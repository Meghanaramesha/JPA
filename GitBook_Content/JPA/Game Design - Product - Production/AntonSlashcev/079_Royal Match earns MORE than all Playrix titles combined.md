Playrix had 4 big games.  
Dream Games had just one.  
Now Royal Match earns MORE than all Playrix titles combined.

Playrix diversified.  
But they lacked focus.  
Slow updates.   
Limited innovation.   
Weak market adaptation.  
  
Dream Games took a different route:  
One game.   
Total dedication.   
Rapid market adaptation.  
No clones, just relentless experimentation.  
They didn’t move on until Royal Match dominated.  
  
Playrix spread their bets.  
Dream Games doubled down.  
  
🔻 $127M/month — all 4 Playrix hits combined  
🟢 $134M/month — Royal Match alone  
  
Diversification protects you from failure.  
𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗽.
