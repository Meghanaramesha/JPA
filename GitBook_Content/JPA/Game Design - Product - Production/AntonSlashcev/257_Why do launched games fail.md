# Why do launched games fail?

Why do launched games fail?

It often comes down to one of three things:

1. Weak Product  
↳ The game doesn’t provide enough value to its core players.  
↳ It’s not fun to keep players engaged.

2. Weak Marketing  
↳ The game could be a hit, but it’s lost in the noise.  
↳ Players who would love it simply don’t know it exists.

3. Weak Market Research  
↳ The game resonates with players, but the audience is too small.  
↳ A loyal fanbase is great, but without enough players, costs won’t be covered.

Having a fun game (Point 1) is critical.  
But most games fail because of Points 2 and 3.

So, remember:  
Creating a great game is only half the battle.

To win, you need a sizable niche and the ability to connect with players.
