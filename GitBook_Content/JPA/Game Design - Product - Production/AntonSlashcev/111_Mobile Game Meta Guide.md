###### Mobile Game Meta Guide

🏡 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗮?  
  
• It’s not a new hero, booster, or ability.  
• It’s the layer outside the core loop: rewards, progression, collectibles, narrative.  
• It gives players goals that feel fresh—without breaking the game’s balance.  
  
❓ 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗮𝗱𝗱 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗮?  
  
Because it:  
• Adds depth without power creep  
• Scales cheaply (mostly art & narrative)  
• Opens up easy A/B tests  
• Boosts retention and ARPU  
• Creates endless Live-Ops hooks: collections, events, FOMO  
  
⭐ 𝗣𝗼𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗮 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀:   
  
• Decoration: rooms, gardens (Homescapes)  
• Leaderboards: ranks, badges (Marvel SNAP)  
• City-building: slots → coins → village (Coin Master)  
• Collections: stickers, pets (Merge Mansion)  
• Storylines: chapters, cut-scenes (Episode)  
• Campaigns: world maps, biomes (mid-core RPGs)  
• Customization: skins, outfits (Overwatch)  
• Romance: branching relationships (Choices)  
  
🕵️ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲?  
  
• Match-3: decoration + light story  
• PvP: skins + ranks  
• Mid-core: base-building + epic cut-scenes  
• Casual sims: expansive city + collections  
  
But skip meta if your game relies on tight skill loops (like Sudoku or rhythm).  
  
✅ 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗮 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁:  
  
1. Lock the core loop first  
2. Choose your KPI (retention? ARPU?)  
3. Gate meta softly (open after level 3–5)  
4. Track usage & skip rates  
5. Build 3+ months of content before launch  
  
❌ 𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗽𝘀:  
  
• Too many meta systems at once  
• Shared currency between core & meta  
• Meta access too early or too pricey  
• UI that distracts from gameplay  
  
Meta isn’t the main course.  
  
But it’s often the reason players stay for dessert.
