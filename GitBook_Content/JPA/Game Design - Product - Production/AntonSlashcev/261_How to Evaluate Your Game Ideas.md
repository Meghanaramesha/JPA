How to Evaluate Your Game Ideas?  
  
Here are some critical questions you need to ask:  
  
1. Market Size:   
• Is your genre growing or declining?   
• Are new developers entering the niche, or is it saturated?   
• How could future trends and technology impact your genre?  
  
2. Competitive Analysis:   
• Who are your competitors, and what made them successful?   
• Why did similar games fail?   
• What makes your game stand out?  
  
3. Know Your Audience:   
• Who is your audience, and what do they value (e.g., story, competition)?   
• What are people saying about similar games on platforms like Reddit, Steam, or App Store?  
  
4. Core Game Design:   
• Can you pitch your game in one sentence?   
• Does the art style and core gameplay loop stand out?   
• What will keep players coming back?  
  
5. Marketing & Community Building:   
• How will you reach and engage your audience?   
• Can you imagine your game going viral, or partnering with influencers?  
  
6. Monetization Strategy:   
• Will you choose premium, free-to-play, or ad-based models?   
• How will you structure in-game purchases to enhance gameplay without disrupting it?  
  
7. Development Plan:   
• How long will it take to release the game?   
• What are the main technical or design risks?   
• Can you build a demo to validate your idea?  
  
8. Financials:   
• How much funding is needed to break even?   
• What KPIs will define success?
