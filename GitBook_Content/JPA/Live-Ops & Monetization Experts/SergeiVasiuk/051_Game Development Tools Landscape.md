# Game Development Tools Landscape

###### I wish I had the tools available today when I joined gaming 12 years ago.

Still, 3 sins can ruin your game production.   
  
(I must admit, I’ve committed all 3 sins)  
  
1. “Why buy this tool? A weekend and energy drinks, and I’ll make a new one.   
  
It’ll even make coffee!”  
  
Avoid this because:  
  
• 61% producers aim for 1–2-week releases.  
• that’s a lot of energy drinks.  
• not enough weekends.  
  
2. “Our custom tool? It’s so unique, only three people in the world understand it.  
  
Two of them just quit.”  
  
Avoid this because:  
  
• 53% longer to onboard with in-house tools  
• less focus in creating the game experience  
• the remaining one writes in hieroglyphs.  
  
3. “This third-party AI pathfinding? My pet could write better algorithms.   
  
Hold my keyboard.”  
  
Avoid this because:  
  
• 66% of development timelines fall short.  
• solving solved issues wastes resources.  
• wheel reinvention proves its necessity.  
  
“Okay, your idea, Sergei?” – I hear you ask.  
  
Your focus: content, not custom tech.  
  
65% of all studios now prefer to ‘buy vs build’ their game technology.  
  
The game industry has matured, offering new, powerful solutions.
