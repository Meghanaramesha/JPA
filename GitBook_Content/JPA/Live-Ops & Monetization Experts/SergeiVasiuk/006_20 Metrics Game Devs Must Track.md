# 20 Metrics Game Devs Must Track

###### 20 Metrics Every Game Dev Needs to Track

Most game devs overcomplicate data.  
  
They obsess over every metric  
↳ and miss the ones that matter.  
  
Let’s cut the noise.  
  
If you’re running a live service game,  
You need to track three key pillars:  
  
📌 New Players  
↳ How you bring people in.  
  
📌 Active Players  
↳ How you keep them engaged.  
  
📌 Paying Players  
↳ How you drive revenue.  
  
Simple. But here’s the kicker –   
  
20% of your game’s metrics drive  
80% of your game’s success.  
  
Know them. Track them.  
  
And most importantly, use them.
