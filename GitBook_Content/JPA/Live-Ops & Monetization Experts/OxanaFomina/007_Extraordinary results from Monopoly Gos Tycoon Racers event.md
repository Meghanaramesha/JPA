###### In June 2024, [Scopely](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scopely/)‘s Monopoly Go introduced “Tycoon Racers,”

Team-based event that delivered extraordinary results: a 48.8% revenue increase and a 71% jump in Average Revenue Per Daily Active User, according to [Sensor Tower](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sensor-tower/) data.

This marks the second consecutive year a Monopoly Go event has ranked among the top five monetization events in mobile gaming.  
What made it work? Building on the success of their 2023 “Baking Partners” event, the team enhanced:  
✅ 𝐓𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐝𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐬 – expanding from pairs to teams, creating stronger social obligations  
✅ 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 – introducing real-time competition against other teams  
✅ 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐜𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐬 – breaking into shorter tournaments requiring daily participation  
✅ 𝐑𝐞𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐩𝐬𝐲𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 – implementing choice-based rewards with higher perceived value  
✅ 𝐀𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 – allowing resource collection before events begin  
  
The evolution from “Baking Partners” to “Tycoon Racers” demonstrates how thoughtful enhancement of social mechanics, competition frameworks, and reward structures can dramatically increase monetization effectiveness.  
Both events continue driving revenue and engagement today, providing valuable lessons for game developers: analyzing successful event mechanics—both yours and competitors’—can significantly boost your game’s performance metrics.
