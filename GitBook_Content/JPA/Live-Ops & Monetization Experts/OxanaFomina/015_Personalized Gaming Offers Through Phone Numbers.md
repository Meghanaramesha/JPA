# Personalized Gaming Offers Through Phone Numbers

###### The trend of expanding sales channels for in-app purchases (IAP) continues. Initially, sales were available only through the Apple and Google stores, then web shops appeared.

Now, there is a trend of selling in-game purchases through messenger services, where you can send push messages and personalized offers specifically for that player, which won’t be available to others.  
  
Two pioneering games, Monopoly GO! by [Scopely](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scopely/) and Coin Master by [Moon Active](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moon-active/) are leading the charge by collecting phone numbers from users beyond the conventional Facebook Connect and email integrations. This strategy opens many opportunities to deepen engagement and streamline the sales process.  
  
I see this as a golden opportunity to expand communication channels with players and innovate to sell in-game currency. Imagine leveraging direct-to-consumer technology with a ‘Buy Button’ that can be seamlessly integrated into any messaging app. This personalizes the player’s journey, making each interaction unique.  
  
How do you perceive the use of phone numbers in enhancing player engagement and sales strategies? Are there other innovative approaches we should consider to capitalize on this trend?
