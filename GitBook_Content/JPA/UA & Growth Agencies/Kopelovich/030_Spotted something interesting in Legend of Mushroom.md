🌟Spotted something interesting in Legend of Mushroom:

the game is running an Outfit Design Contest, and when you click on the in-game banner, it takes you directly to their Discord channel for details and submissions.  
  
Why I love this approach:  
✅ Seamlessly bridges in-game engagement with community platforms  
✅ Encourages players to step outside the game while still staying in the ecosystem  
✅ Strengthens long-term retention by building a sense of community beyond just gameplay  
  
It’s a small but smart example of how games can collaborate with platforms like Discord to extend the player journey, drive creativity, and reward community involvement.  
  
👉 Would you like to see more games using Discord (or similar platforms) as part of their LiveOps loops?
