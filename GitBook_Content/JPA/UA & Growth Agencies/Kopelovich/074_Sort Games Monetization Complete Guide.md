Hello and welcome back, everyone!

Thank you for joining me for another genre exploration in our journey through the diverse world of mobile gaming monetization. If you missed our last discussion on the most utilized monetization strategies in merge games, be sure to check it out [here](https://www.gamigion.com/merge-games-monetization-complete-guide/). It’s full of insights that might inspire your next big idea, regardless of the genre you’re currently working on.

Today, we’re delving into the captivating world of sort games. While different from merge games, the principles of monetization remain universal and highly adaptable. So, let’s uncover how this genre keeps players engaged and, more importantly, how it turns that engagement into revenue.

### Market Trends and Evolution in Sort Games

Sort games have seen a massive surge in popularity over the past few years, evolving from ultra-casual tap experiences into deeper, more strategic titles with strong daily engagement. While the mechanics may seem simple—organizing, sorting, or cleaning—top titles in this genre have layered in progression systems, boosters, and meta-loops that make them stickier than ever.

With their highly replayable loops, these games are perfect for light but effective monetization. Developers in the sort space are now using increasingly creative IAP strategies to convert high session volume into revenue, without disrupting the clean, satisfying vibe players expect.

### Real-World IAP Monetization Examples

Here are five monetization strategies commonly seen in sort games, demonstrated through recent live examples:

### “Starter Pack’s”

### Conclusion

Sort games may look simple on the surface, but behind their minimalist UX lies a powerful canvas for monetization. With low-friction gameplay and strong daily retention, players are primed for smart, well-timed offers that support both progression and personalization.

In this first part of the guide, we focused on IAPs—but stay tuned for Part 2, where we’ll explore Rewarded Video placements and how sort games are making the most out of their ad-based revenue potential.
