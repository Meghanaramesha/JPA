**LAGOS, December 2025** In a strategic move to expand its global footprint, mobile gaming giant Supercell announced a new developer grant program specifically for African studios during the recent MaliyoCon conference in Nigeria. This initiative aims to provide non-dilutive funding ranging from $20,000 to $200,000 to support the continent’s emerging talent, marking a significant investment in what many see as the world’s fastest-growing gaming market.

Maliyocon 2025

The announcement reflects a broader shift in Supercell’s strategy to cultivate long-term partnerships worldwide. While specific details of the African grants are new, they align with the company’s recently re-launched “Supercell Investments” arm, which focuses on backing creative, independent teams globally.

### A Focus on Founders and Long-Term Vision

At the heart of Supercell’s investment philosophy is a focus on empowering founders who share their core values: high ambition, creative independence, and a dedication to building “forever games”. This approach is designed to foster long-term success over quick financial returns.

The African grants program extends this ethos. By offering flexible, non-dilutive capital, Supercell aims to help local studios scale operations, acquire talent, or fund marketing without demanding equity or immediate strategic alignment in return.

### Strengthening Ties with Africa’s Gaming Ecosystem

The grant program is not Supercell’s first engagement with Africa, signaling a deeper commitment to the region:

* **Partnerships for Access:** Supercell partnered with African publisher Carry1st to support local in-game payments, making its hit titles more accessible across the continent.
* **Building Community Ties:** In 2024, the company invited studios from Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Kenya to its annual “Games First” developer gathering in Helsinki.
* **Expert Leadership:** The appointment of industry veteran Lasse Seppänen as General Manager of its London studio in late 2025 is seen as strengthening its leadership for global and emerging market operations.

### A Strategic, Long-Game Approach

Industry analysis suggests that while Supercell’s investment style differs from aggressive corporate venture capital, it is a deliberate long-term strategy.

The company has historically prioritized finding and nurturing exceptional creative teams that align with its culture of small, independent “cells.” Critics argue this approach caused them to miss acquiring major studios during the mobile gaming boom of 2016-2022. However, supporters see it as a principled bet on organic creativity rather than financial engineering.

By launching a grant program for Africa, Supercell is applying this patient, founder-focused philosophy to a high-potential market early in its growth cycle. The goal appears to be community building and discovering the next generation of gaming talent, rather than seeking immediate strategic control.

### Looking Ahead

This grant initiative arrives as Supercell celebrates historic success with its live game *Brawl Stars* and navigates the challenges of launching new titles like *Squad Busters*. By investing in Africa’s burgeoning developer scene, the company is not just funding games—it is investing in the future players and creators of the global gaming community.

For African studios, Supercell’s grants represent a major validation and a crucial source of risk capital. For the global industry, it is a signal that one of mobile gaming’s most influential players is doubling down on a truly worldwide vision for the next generation of games.

**Potential Benefits for African Studios:**

* **Non-Dilutive Capital:** Funding without giving up company equity.
* **Strategic Flexibility:** Grants can be used for talent, operations, or marketing as the studio sees fit.
* **Validation & Profile:** Association with a global industry leader.
* **Network Access:** Potential connection to a community of over 1,000 game professionals.

**Supercell’s Strategic Goals:**

* **Early Market Access:** Establish a presence in the world’s fastest-growing gaming market.
* **Cultural Insight:** Gain understanding of diverse player preferences and new design trends.
* **Long-Term Pipeline:** Identify and nurture future partner studios or acquisition targets.
* **Brand Leadership:** Strengthen its position as a supporter of global game development.
